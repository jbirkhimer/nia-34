Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is crucial for memory functionsand recovery from stress in rodents. Little is known about human AHN in healthy aging and Alzheimer?s Disease(AD), less is known about age and AD effects on synaptic plasticity and brain circuits. In aging rodents and non-human primates, adult-generated neural cells tend to favor differentiation into glia instead of neurons, butphylogenetic differences dictate human studies. AHN studies require rigorous methods for visualization of AHNmarkers and data interpretation. These include assuring brain tissue quality, standardized tissue processing, useof brain toxicology and neuropathology, and strict clinical inclusion\\/exclusion criteria based on adequate clinicaldata. We and others have confirmed persistent AHN with aging in subjects without AD, but we found age-associated declines in angiogenesis and neuroplasticity as defined by expression of polysialiated cell adhesionmolecule (PSA-NCAM) in fewer cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), which could reflect changes at the dendrite,spine or synaptic level, because PSA-NCAM is expressed with dendrite remodeling, neuron migration, and longterm potentiation. Our preliminary data show that Kruppel Like Factor 9 (Klf9), a transcription factor necessaryfor neurogenesis-dependent synaptic plasticity and neuronal differentiation, declines with normal aging in humanDG. We reported that the age-related angiogenesis decline is directly proportional to fewer cells expressing PSA-NCAM. Angiogenesis and AHN are regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), andwe have pilot data showing fewer intra- and extra-vascular DG cells expressing VEGFR2 in older people. Studiesof AHN in AD have shown conflicting findings of increased, no change, and deficits of AHN correlating withcognitive decline. We propose new techniques that have never been applied to study AHN, dendrite, spine,synaptic and vascular plasticity in normal human aging or AD brain tissue. To understand what sustains AHNand synaptogenesis, we will examine their relationship to expression of molecular regulators (Klf9 and VEGFR2).The sample will include hippocampi from the Brain Banks of NIMH and the New York AD Research Center: 80without neuropsychiatric illness, neuropathology or psychotropic drug use, age 14-90, and 20 with AD, age 65-90. Aims: 1. To study the neuronal or glial phenotype of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells and quantify AHN andgliogenesis across the human lifespan. 2. To study age-associated changes in dendrite, spine and synapsesand their molecular regulator Klf9 in CA1, CA3 and DG: 2a. Golgi-stained dendrite and spines; 2b. Number andlength of neurofilament-immunoreactive dendrites; 2c. Pre\\/post-synaptic and dendritic protein expression:SYN1, PSD95 and spinophilin; 2d. Klf9 mRNA levels. 3. To assess age-associated angiogenesis decline andVEGFR2 levels in DG-CA regions. 4. To examine AHN and neurovascular plasticity changes in AD (as in Aim1-3). 5. To test how stress, BMI, and GAS correlate with AHN and neurovascular plasticity across the lifespan.--Project NarrativeIn 2050; the population aged 65 yrs. and over will be almost double the number in 2012; increasing theimportance of late life cognitive health and resilience; which in animals depends on new neuron production inthe hippocampus (hippocampal neurogenesis); their number of connections in brain circuits; and brain bloodflow. We and others have shown that new neurons are made in the hippocampus throughout life in medicallyhealthy people; but we don?t know how well connected with other neurons these new neurons become; becausewe found a decline in brain blood vessels with age and need to know if this is reversible with treatment. In thisproject; we will study the growth of new neurons; examine how stem cells separate off into other types of cellsand measure connectivity and blood vessel health in normally aging individuals compared to Alzheimer?sDisease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTConsumption of saturated fats and refined sugars has dramatically increased in the last century and, notsurprisingly, obesity rates have risen concomitantly. Approximately 30% of older adults (65 and older) are obese,and this is alarming because obesity among this age group has been associated with cognitive impairments anddementia, such as Alzheimer?s Disease. There is growing evidence that obesity-related neuroinflammation mayplay a prominent role in Alzheimer?s disease initiation and\\/or progression. However, there is a fundamental gapin understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in this relationship. Preclinical data indicate that evenshort-term consumption of high-fat diets (HFD) triggers a potent neuroinflammatory response in thehippocampus and amygdala, causing profound spatial, contextual, and emotional memory deficits. The long-term goal is to develop effective interventions to prevent and reverse debilitating memory declines in the agedpopulation caused by unhealthy diets or obesity. The objective of this application is to understand themechanisms that underlie aging-associated HFD-induced hippocampal- and amygdalar-dependent memoryimpairments. Short-term HFD consumption will be used in this proposal to avoid having the many co-morbiditiesassociated with obesity confound results and interpretations. The central hypothesis is that the interaction ofaging and HFD causes profound memory impairments through neuroinflammation-evoked deterioration ofsynaptic plasticity, as measured by long-term potentiation, in both the hippocampus and the amygdala. Guidedby strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the extentto which HFD consumption disrupts LTP in the hippocampus and amygdala, and 2) Determine the extent towhich central IL-1b mediates HFD-induced LTP disruptions in aged rats. The approach is innovative, in theapplicant?s opinion, because it will determine, for the first time, whether neuroinflammation, caused by HFDconsumption, in the amygdala and hippocampus leads to impairments in LTP. The proposed research issignificant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of early mechanisms of hippocampaland amygdalar dysfunction in the aged population following HFD consumption. Ultimately, such knowledge willlead to novel approaches to slow or prevent further cognitive declines that could otherwise develop intoAlzheimer?s disease.--Project NarrativeThe proposed research is relevant to public health because it will elucidate how high-fat diets(HFD) profoundly impair contextual; spatial; and emotional memories in the elderly; which willprovide insights into early triggers of Alzheimer?s Disease. It will determine the extent to whichHFD-induced memory impairments are driven by degradation of synaptic plasticity mechanismsin the hippocampus; amygdala; or both. Consistent with the mission of the NIH; this work willhave broad positive impact by preventing devastating and potentially dangerous memoryimpairments in the elderly; which in turn will improve quality of life.\"},{\"abstract\":\"AbstractNeurodegeneration-related decline affects the health of millions of patients withAlzheimer's disease worldwide and imposes a heavy emotional and financial burden onpatients, their families, and their communities. Commonly-used brain activity recordingmethods cannot probe single-cell activity and therapeutic approaches are evaluatedbased on their success at relieving disease symptoms, and not their ability to restorenormal neuronal functionality. Therefore, the relationships between age-relatedneurodegeneration, impaired brain circuitry, and disrupted neuronal activity patterns inAlzheimer's disease are poorly understood, and there are clear knowledge gapsregarding how they change during disease progression. Drs. Dana, Raber and theircolleagues offer a new approach for chronic recording of the activity from tens ofthousands of neurons across the mouse cortex, with single-cell resolution, and in freely-moving mice. This approach will be used for longitudinal recording of cortex-wide activityin mouse model of Alzheimer's disease-like degeneration during cognitive and behavioraltasks, in order to identify neurodegeneration-related changes in cortical activity patterns.--Project NarrativeIn order to understand how diseases like Alzheimer's affect the normal activity of thebrain; we need to develop a new method for recording activity from single neurons in thebrain of animal models of age-related degeneration. In this project; Drs. Dana and Raberpresent a new method to address this challenge; and to link changes in activity of multiplebrain regions with the progression of age-related degeneration in a mouse model ofAlzheimer's disease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Sporadic Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and it has no cure or effective treatment. The vast majority of therapies are based on the amyloid hypothesis, which postulates that amyloid A?accumulation in the brain is the key disease initiator. Accordingly, those therapies have focused on removingexcess A? but, unfortunately, they have failed to produce clinical improvements. It is now evident that AD is aheterogeneous disease with likely several contributing pathogenic factors, a fact that hampers both our understanding of the disease and the design of evidence-based therapies. Of those factors, cholesterol dysregulationis prominent, being linked to at least 20% of the population at risk of developing dementia. This specific at-riskpopulation would benefit from our understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms linked to cholesteroldysregulation. In that respect, one key mechanism by which cholesterol dysregulation is involved in AD pathogenesis is through the accumulation of its oxidized metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC). Our laboratoryhas unveiled a novel protective mechanism against 27OHC cytotoxicity. We have shown that, in vitro, the intracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein, AICD, drives a neuroprotective hormetic response against27OHC through the upregulation of the oxysterol stress responder RTKN2 to optimize neuroprotection. Thisresponse was deficient in autopsy brain samples from AD patients and in brains of mice fed a long-term Westerndiet, a significant risk factor for AD that increases 27OHC in the brain. Thus, our data show that AICD-drivenhormesis against 27OHC occurs in vitro and suggest that its activation could be implicated in supporting brainhomeostasis and maintaining cognitive function. Accordingly, our long-term goal is to understand the hormeticmechanisms in the brain against 27OHC to ultimately optimize them for therapeutic purposes. The overall objective of this particular proposal is to demonstrate that hormesis against 27OHC occurs in the brain as a mechanism to optimize synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. Supported by strong data, our central hypothesis isthat incremental exposure to dietary cholesterol, through the accumulation of 27OHC, will elicit a hormetic-response window in the mouse brain, measurable by changes in AICD-driven RTKN2 expression, hippocampalsynaptic plasticity and cognitive function. We will test our hypothesis with the following Specific Aim: Measurethe changes in AICD-driven RTKN2 expression, hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognition in mice in response to increasing amounts of cholesterol in the diet. We will use sterol 27-hydroxylase-null mice, which donot generate 27OHC, and control mice, fed a standard or 0.06%, 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.375% and 0.5% cholesterol-rich diets, to measure AICD-driven RTKN2 expression, evaluate synaptic plasticity in organotypic hippocampalslices and assess a range of behavioral tasks widely used to characterize mouse models of AD. Our approachis innovative because it describes a novel neuroprotective mechanism against a known risk factor for AD and itscontribution is significant because optimization of that mechanism will provide evidence-based therapy targets.--This proposal is relevant to public health because of its potential to unveil a novel  neuroprotective mechanism against a well-known risk factor for Alzheimer?s disease. Thus; this proposal is relevant to the part of NIH?s mission that relates to the development of vital knowledge that will help to manage the societal and financial costs of dementia and other neurodegenerative conditions.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYAlzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitivedecline and dementia. Although the mechanisms underlying AD are still largely unknown, it is clear that agingof the brain is a key risk factor for this disease. Several lines of evidence indicate that microglia, the myeloidimmune cells of the brain, play a crucial role in the processes involved in normal aging of the central nervoussystem and development of AD. Recent genetic studies have identified over twenty novel AD risk loci, andnetwork analysis have shown that a major part of these loci play a role in the myeloid immune system. Inaddition, gene expression changes have been found in microglia of aged individuals, subjects with AD and inmicroglia in mice models for AD. How these microglia changes contribute to AD is not yet clear. Answering thisquestion is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms involved in AD. In addition, this couldlead to unravelling novel targets for treatment of AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. The long-termgoal of this project is to deepen our insight into the role of microglia cells in AD and to identify microglia-relatedtargets for treatment of age-related disorders of the central nervous system. An important first step towardsreaching this goal is to understand what the changes that have been found microglia in AD tell us in terms ofchanges in gene and protein expression and functions. The overall objective of this study is therefore toidentify the AD-associated common genetic variants that alters microglia gene expression at baseline and inresponse to inflammatory stimuli. By combining the unique expertise of the two PIs in the isolation and cultureof human microglia, as well as advanced computational genomics analysis of human myeloid immune cells. InAim 1, we will use 264 existing microglia samples that we have previously isolated of different regions of 103brain donors to generate genotype and transcriptome profiles. By combining these data with existing microgliatranscriptomic datasets, we will be able to generate a map of how AD-associated genetic loci influence geneexpression (or expression quantitative trait loci, eQTL) and splicing (sQTL). In aim 2, we will use interferon(IFN) stimulated microglial samples that we have previously collected to characterize how AD-associated riskvariants alter IFN-stimulated transcriptome changes. These profiles will be validated in new microgliatranscriptomes from an independent cohort of 15 donors to determine the response of these samples tointerferon and A? and sort subsets with different phagocytic capacity. The transcriptome profiles andexpression and splicing QTL that will be generated in these two aims will be made publically available and wewill apply these profiles to very large available gene datasets on aged and AD brain tissue and peripheralmonocytes to investigate how gene expression changes relate to changes in microglia function. Together, weexpect that this study will provide key information bridging AD genetics to molecular mechanisms in microglia,setting the stage for future mechanistic studies in model systems.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThe premise of this application is that microglia plays an important role in brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) buta clear scientific gap exists in our understanding how microglia contribute to these processes at the functionallevel. The long-term goal of this project is to deepen our insight into the role of microglia cells in AD and toidentify microglia-related targets for treatment of the disease. If successful; discoveries from this study willprovide a foundation for more ambitious plans to identify potential mechanisms and modulating factors for theincreased risk of neurodegenerative disease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTEpilepsy is frequently associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but whether there are shared commonmechanisms is largely unknown. Network hyperactivity due to altered functional connectivity of GABAergicinterneurons is believed to underlie many cognitive disorders and a ?disease of interneurons? is the majorhypothesis for epilepsy. However, little is known about the pathophysiology of interneurons particularly inpatients with Apo4-associated AD and epilepsy. Understanding the role of ApoE4 in interneuron dysfunctionrequires direct investigation of interneuron properties in human neurons derived from patients with thesemutations. Reprogramming patient somatic cells enables recapitulation of normal and pathological humantissue developmental properties in defined conditions and a new way to identify the cellular processesunderlying complex human diseases, which can lead to mechanism-based drug discovery. Aim 1 will testthe hypothesis that ApoE4 will cause degeneration of GABAergic neurons in 3D cortical spheroids which isassociated with AD-related pathology by labeling spheroids with a Dlx1\\/2-GFP reporter to monitorinterneuron behavior and correlating these cellular changes with AD-related pathology. Aim 2 will test thehypothesis that ApoE4-dependent degeneration will lead to hyperexcitability in 3D cortical spheroids byperforming multi-electrode array recordings to measure baseline neural activity and after exposure withdifferent anti-seizure drugs. Together, these studies are expected to provide a greater understanding ofhow ApoE4 functions in human cortical interneuron development and function at the network level,therefore contributing to the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD, which could help uncover newstrategies to treat patients with AD and epilepsy.--PROJECT NARRATIVE:Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is among the greatest public health concern in the United States; oftenhaving considerable effects on the functional capacity of the individual. Now; however; use of humaninduced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from patients allows the ability to identify genotype-to-phenotype relationships and elucidate the molecular; cellular; and circuit-level mechanisms. Thisresearch proposal using patient-derived iPSC and organoid models will lead to improvedunderstanding of Alzheimer's Disease; possibly leading to the development of new drugs for repairand regeneration of the nervous system.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryThe increased risk of Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) in women compared to men has been widely reported,including increased prevalence and also severity of cognitive impairment in women with AD than men. Womenalso exhibit an accelerated rate of impairment. However, there is considerable debate as to the physiologicalbasis for this increased susceptibility. One potential key candidate mechanism that may underlie thisvulnerability is differences in synaptic structure and function. To examine this question, we have opted toutilize a preclinical mouse model that exhibits endophenotypes of AD as well as normal aging mice. Inparticular, the familial AD 5xFAD transgenic mouse model recapitulates many AD characteristics, includingan early aggressive amyloid-\\u00c3\\u009f (A\\u00c3\\u009f) pathology in the cortex and hippocampus, regions known to be necessaryfor learning and memory. We will test our hypothesis that synaptic density represents a key source ofvulnerability to AD pathology in females as compared to males. Three distinct Aims will test this hypothesis.First, Aim 1 will evaluate the temporal progression of behavioral decrements in 5xFAD (male\\/female) mice aswell as wild type (WT) mice from 4 through 24 mo of age. In addition, memory processes and also long-termpotentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory, will be assessed at thesame ages. Second, Aim 2 will use clinically relevant magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (dMRI) tomap brain learning and memory circuits, probing the hippocampus and related brain structures forconnectivity. Third, Aim 3 will explore the use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with an 18Fradioligand to probe the synaptic marker, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (S2VA) in our WT and 5xFADcohort. Preliminary studies have demonstrated loss of S2VA labeling in human AD patients, but have notexplored sex-specific alterations. In sum, this research proposal will define the accelerated sex-specificchanges in synaptic connectivity, density and physiological function that underlie the increased vulnerabilityof females when AD pathology is present. Moreover, we will identify when this vulnerability emerges with thefuture goal of intervening to either prevent or slow the progression of AD pathology.--Project NarrativeThe increased risk of Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) in women compared to men has been widely reported.Women with AD are more cognitively impaired than men and have an accelerated rate of impairment;however; there is considerable debate as to physiological basis for this increased susceptibility.

While the need to develop new neuroprotectivetherapeutics has never been higher, our current efforts rely on only a partial understanding of the molecular,cellular, and circuit mechanism that drive changes in the aging brain. One such change is increased oxidativestress arising partially from the brain?s high metabolic needs and exacerbated by brain enrichment of oxidation-catalyzing transition metals and incorporation of peroxidation-sensitive polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)species into phospholipid membranes. Accumulation of peroxidized lipids results in membrane damage andferroptosis, an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic mode of cell death. Our preliminary data suggest that neurons,astrocytes, and microglia are susceptible to ferroptosis, whereas oligodendrocytes are resistant. However, themechanisms regulating differential susceptibility to ferroptosis in these cell types remain unknown.One possible connection between ferroptosis and neurodegeneration is apolipoprotein E (apoE), the primarylipid and cholesterol transport protein of the central nervous system (CNS). APOE gene variants modulate theprobability of developing neurodegenerative disease, with each apoE4 allele conferring an approximately 2-foldincrease in risk for late-onset Alzheimer?s disease compared the more common apoE3 allele. In contrast, theapoE2 variant is enriched in cognitively-intact elders. While many characteristics differentiate apoE4 from theother isoforms, including decreased protein stability and altered lipid transport, no one mechanism is consideredresponsible for increased risk of neurodegeneration in apoE4 carriers. Recent work shows that apoE mediatestransfer of peroxidation-sensitive fatty acids from neurons to astrocytes during periods of enhanced neuronalactivity, suggesting that deficient capacity for lipid transport could lead to accumulation of these potentially toxicspecies in neurons. Interestingly, our preliminary data suggest that astrocytes expressing apoE3 may beprotected against some forms of ferroptosis compared to apoE knockout astrocytes, but that this susceptibilitycan be rescued by exogenous application of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDL).We propose to validate our initial findings using primary culture of CNS cells. Because interactions among celltypes in the brain are critical for modeling of brain lipid metabolism, we will use organotypic slice culture toinvestigate the impact of apoE isoform on ferroptosis sensitivity. To characterize how isoform-dependentdifferences in apoE-lipid interactions impact CNS ferroptosis sensitivity, we will complex apoE to purified plasmaHDL and test how these particles impact ferroptosis sensitivity. Lastly, we will identify the lipid species conferringresistance to ferroptosis in our preliminary data by constructing apoE lipoprotein nanoparticles containingindividual HDL lipid species and testing their function in cellular assays of ferroptosis sensitivity.--Despite having known for many years that variants of the APOE gene; which encodes the lipid and cholesteroltransport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE); are key mediators of brain health; a conclusive mechanism by which apoE modifies brain health and susceptibility to disease remains elusive. This project seeks to betterunderstand how the apoE4 and apoE2 isoforms respectively confer risk for - or resilience to - unhealthy brain aging; poor recovery following brain injury; and development of neurodegenerative diseases by studyingthe connection between apoE isoform and a recently-identified mechanism of cell death; ferroptosis.Expanding our current understanding of apoE function brings critical new insight to brain health in agingand disease and has the potential to inform the development of new therapeutics.\"},{\"abstract\":\"The profound loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) is an early hallmark in Alzheimer?s disease(AD). As cholinergic innervation is essential for cognition, degeneration of BFCNs may be linked to mentaldecline in AD patients. Current AD therapies involving cholinergic drugs provide modest benefits but are notbased on disease mechanisms and do not halt BFCN degeneration. The reasons for the vulnerability of BFCNsto cell death in AD are largely unknown, but BFCN loss predicts degeneration in cortex, and cholinesteraseinhibitors reduce atrophy in basal forebrain as well as cortex and hippocampus. These observations support thepremise that protection of BFCNs could slow pathogenesis in AD. Thus, there is an urgent need to identifymolecular mechanisms of cell death in BFCNs. In this proposal, we will investigate molecular events associatedwith BFCN dysfunction. We focus on neuronal hyperexcitability, which is a prominent, early feature in AD patientslinked to cognitive deficits. Hyperactivity induces homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP), a compensatorymechanism that tunes synaptic strength in response to perturbations in neuronal activity, thereby maintainingexcitation within an optimal range and preserving network stability. However, little is known regarding HSP inmammalian CNS cholinergic synapses, in normal conditions or in AD models. We will test the hypothesis thathyperexcitation and HSP mechanisms exacerbate AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we propose that BFCNs,which are highly vulnerable and affected early in AD, provide a sensitive readout for detecting such dysfunctions.We propose the following aims: 1) Using an optimized septal-hippocampal co-culture system, we will examinethe course of normal BFCN and cholinergic synapse development; determine morphological and functionalchanges that occur in cholinergic neurons and synapses during overexcitation conditions; and utilize similar co-cultures prepared from an AD mouse model to examine the perturbations to BFCNs in their normal development,response to hyperexcitation, and susceptibility to distinct forms of cell death. 2) We will analyze BFCNs andtarget hippocampal neurons in vivo with multidisciplinary approaches to examine the homeostatic responses tohyperexcitation, and use ChAT-Cre mice crossed to an AD mouse model to identify impairments in BFCNstructure or synaptic function, under both basal and hyperexcitation conditions. These significant studies useinnovative technology to investigate questions of basic and translational importance. If successful, the findingsmay lead to improved therapies against BFCN neurodegeneration in AD.--Alzheimer?s disease is the most common form of age-related dementia and is characterized by accumulation ofamyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain; as well as progressive cognitive and memory deficits. One of themost profoundly disturbed pathways is the cholinergic system; and elucidating physiological mechanisms ofcholinergic neuron degeneration may provide therapies that could potentially slow or reverse diseaseprogression.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACT Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating chronic neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause ofdementia in older adults. One of the hallmark pathologies of AD is accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta(A?) ?plaques?. These plaques can form both in the parenchyma as well as in the walls of meningeal andcerebral blood vessels. Vascular A? plaques, termed cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), are present in up to98% of AD patients and can cause stroke, dementia, inflammation, cortical microbleeds, and hemorrhage.Despite the serious clinical ramifications of CAA, it remains unclear why plaques develop in vascular walls.With therapeutic prevention of CAA as a long-term goal, this proposal aims to investigate the role of microgliain regulating cholesterol homeostasis in endothelial cells (ECs)??the cells that make up the walls of bloodvessels. There are several epidemiological links between cholesterol and AD, yet the specific mechanismsunderlying this association are unknown. Our preliminary data show that microglial depletion causesupregulation of cholesterol synthesis enzymes in brain ECs. Because a higher cellular levels of esterifiedcholesterol have been shown to increase A? production, we hypothesize that microglial dysfunction in ADdisrupts brain EC cholesterol metabolism, driving A? production and secretion, thereby potentiating CAA in AD.This proposal will test this novel hypothesis and will also determine how dietary cholesterol modulates brainEC cholesterol metabolism. Specifically, we will test how microglial depletion affects cholesterol synthesis inother neural cell types by quantifying expression of cholesterol synthesis machinery in astrocytes, neurons,and oligodendrocytes. As brain ECs lie at the interface between the brain and the blood, we will alsoinvestigate how increasing dietary cholesterol with a high fat diet modulates cholesterol metabolism in brainECs. Finally, we will assess the separate and combined effects of microglial depletion and high fat diet onvascular pathology in a model of AD. Taken together, the experiments proposed here will advance ourunderstanding of the association between cholesterol and AD, particualrly CAA. Furthermore, these data willidentify whether therapeutic regulation of cholesterol synthesis or efflux specifically in brain ECs could be asuccessful clinical strategy for preventing CAA.--PROJECT NARRATIVEAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the buildup of amyloidplaques in the brain; which can be associated with neuronal and glial cells or with blood vessels. Vascularplaques; termed cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA); have serious clinical ramifications including dementia;stroke; microbleeds; and hemorrhage.

In the central nervoussystem (CNS), ApoE is mainly produced by glia and astrocytes and transports cholesterol to neurons via ApoEreceptors, which are members of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family. ApoE isoform-specific interactions with A?, namely ApoE\\/A? complex, modulates A? levels and is implicated in A?clearance. C\\/EBP? is an inflammatory cytokines-regulated transcription factor that can be activated by A? aswell. Interestingly, we have recently reported that C\\/EBP? acts as an age-dependent transcription factor fordelta-secretase (AEP, also called legumain). This crucial protease cleaves both APP and Tau in human ADbrains and AD mouse models, promoting amyloidogenic pathway and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation.Inactivation of delta-secretase substantially decreases A? deposits and NFT aggregation and abolishes ADpathologies in various AD mouse models. In our preliminary studies, we found that C\\/EBP? binds ApoEpromoter and dictates ApoE mRNA transcription during aging. Knockout of C\\/EBP? in 3xTg greatly reducesApoE levels and senile plaques. On the other hand, ApoE4 but not E3 strongly activates C\\/EBP? in primaryneurons. Blockage of ApoE4 interaction with its receptor diminishes this effect. Moreover, 27-hydroxycholesterol displays much stronger effect in stimulating C\\/EBP? than cholesterol in the presence ofApoE4. Hence, we hypothesize that ApoE4 and 27-oxycholesterol trigger C\\/EBP? activation, which feedsback and upregulates ApoE transcription in AD pathogenesis. Consequently, this vicious loop mayfacilitate AD pathologies via escalating delta-secretase levels. To define the molecular mechanisms betweenApoE4\\/C\\/EBP? crosstalk will provide an innovative insight into the pathological roles of ApoE4 in AD onsetand progression.--The ApoE protein plays many important roles; including the transport of cholesterol across different tissues andcells and clearance of amyloid ?

Accumulation of cholesterol hasbeen observed in affected brain areas from AD patients and animals, and it is associated with region-specificloss of synapses. Elevated brain cholesterol causes cognitive deficits, amyloid-? (A?) production andaggregation, and tau pathology. Despite these observations, the mechanisms that govern brain cholesterolhomeostasis and influence on neurons under AD-related pathological conditions remain elusive. In particular,the field lacks knowledge on the factors that are involved in the signaling pathways of neuronal cholesterolmetabolism, related to the initiation and development of AD pathology. ATAD3A belongs to a new family ofeukaryotic mitochondrial AAA-ATPases. ATAD3A regulates cholesterol homeostasis and trafficking via anunknown mechanism at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), a specialized subdomain of theER that has the features of a lipid raft and is rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin. Our recent workdemonstrated that ATAD3A, via pathological dimerization, showed a gain-of-function that causedneurodegeneration in Huntington's disease. We further observed an enhancement of ATAD3A oligomerizationin AD neuronal culture, in AD transgenic mouse brains and in AD patient postmortem hippocampus,suggesting an aberrant activity of ATAD3A in the pathogenesis of AD. We developed a novel peptide inhibitorDA1 that binds to ATAD3A to block ATAD3A dimerization. Notably, sustained treatment with DA1 reducedAPP level and amyloid load, attenuated neuro-inflammation and improved short-term spatial memory in 5XFADtransgenic mice. Further, our proteomic analysis suggests that blocking ATAD3A oligomerization by DA1treatment mainly influenced the cholesterol metabolic pathway in AD mouse brains. The treatment in ADtransgenic mice improved brain cholesterol turnover and did not affect brain phospholipids levels. Moreover,we showed that DA1 treatment reduced cholesterol burden and oxidative stress in neuronal cells stablyexpressing APP wt or mutant. These findings highlight ATAD3A oligomerization as a previously unidentifiedmechanism underlying brain cholesterol disturbance and neurodegeneration in AD. Our central hypothesis isthat ATAD3A oligomerization mediates amyloid pathology, leading to neurodegeneration, by impairment ofbrain cholesterol metabolism. The overall goal of this application is to understand ATAD3A aberrantoligomerization-mediated neuropathology in AD, and to reveal a novel therapeutic target for AD. In Aim 1, wewill determine the impact of ATAD3A oligomerization on brain cholesterol homeostasis, AD pathology andbehavioral deficits in AD mice. In Aim 2, we will determine whether haplosufficiency of ATAD3A in AD micerestores brain cholesterol homeostasis and reduces AD pathology. In Aim 3, we will dissect the mechanisticlinks between ATAD3A oligomerization and disturbance in brain cholesterol homeostasis in AD.--Brain cholesterol metabolism impairment is an early prominent event in the brains of patients with Alzheimer?sdisease (AD).

Astrocyticendfeet are perfectly positioned to interact with the endothelial vessel walls, and, where present, the surroundingsmooth muscles or pericytes. Through the release of vasoactive molecules such as PGE2, astrocytes regulate localblood flow (functional hyperemia) and through the release of angiogenic signals induce tight junction proteins thatform the blood brain barrier (BBB). Consequently, any condition that compromises the structure or function of theendfoot can cause impaired blood flow or impairments of the BBB. In a previous study using a model of familialAlzheimer disease (AD; hAPPJ202), we1 showed vascular amyloid deposits aggregating between the astrocyticendfeet and the vessel wall and such amyloid laden vessels showed an impaired ability to regulate vascular toneand blood flow upon stimulation. Preliminary data suggests that where amyloid deposits are present on vesselsand endfeet displaced, focal breaches in the BBB occur. However, the causative role of vascular amyloid versusstructural and functional changes of astrocytic endfeet in this context are not known. Indeed, while reduced bloodflow and weakening of the BBB have been demonstrated with aging, the specific role of astrocytes in vessel healthover the lifespan are largely unknown. We hypothesize that normal aging is associated with progressive dysfunctionof astrocytic endfeet causing impairment in functional hyperemia and gradual weakening of the BBB. These agerelatedimpairments are accelerated in the AD brain as a function of amyloid being functionally ?toxic? toastrocytes and\\/or pericytes. Here we propose to use two genetic mouse model of familial AD (hAPPJ202, APP233)with robust vascular amyloidosis1,4 and progressive gliosis1, and age matched control animals to study the specificrole of astrocytes and pericytes to maintain vessel health and function during normal and pathological aging.No prior studies have examined specific functional impairments of astrocyte endfeet in normal aging compared toAD, and a possible specific gliotoxic effect of amyloid; two conceptually innovative ideas. State of the art chronic invivo multi-photon imaging will be applied to well established transgenic mouse models of AD with vascularamyloidosis. Combined with novel cell-type specific genomics and proteomics, this proposal will shed light onastrocyte specific changes in gene and protein expression over the time course of AD (and normal aging) with specificanalysis of gender differences.--Cerebral blood vessels are completely covered by astrocytic processes called endfeet. Recent research shows endfeetreleasing vasoactive molecules that regulate blood flow and tropic molecules that induce and maintain the bloodbrain barrier. It is unknown whether these functions change with aging and may be worsened by the presence ofamyloid in Alzheimer disease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/Abstract: Declining cognitive function is a hallmark feature of the aging process in theelderly population. Since aging is the major risk factor for many leading causes of death, including dementiassuch as Alzheimer's disease (AD), novel targets and strategies are needed as this population grows in the USand beyond. Though the conventional view has held that plasticity is limited in the aged brain, emerging datahas challenged this notion, revealing that factors present within young blood are restorative for aged tissuesthroughout the body while suggesting links between the systemic environment and aging- and Alzheimer's-related changes in the brain. Aged mice sharing young blood via the parabiosis model or through plasmatransfer exhibit improved synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine number, and cognitive performance, which led meto explore novel brain activities for systemic protein factors that may have relevance for AD. Our recentlypublished work uncovered tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2), a protein enriched indevelopmentally-early human and young mouse plasma versus aged plasma that plays a surprisingly centralrole in regulating synaptic plasticity within the hippocampus. I showed that treatment with TIMP2 significantlyrevitalizes hippocampal function, as assessed by gene expression, long-term potentiation, and memoryperformance in hippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks. Moreover, removing TIMP2 from hippocampal slicesdramatically reduced LTP and its loss in plasma ablated cognitive improvements conferred by young plasma.This work has nonetheless left many fundamental questions open related to TIMP2's function within thehippocampus, and its role in Alzheimer's disease remains unexplored. Recent work shows significantlyreduced TIMP2 levels in AD patients with vascular changes in CSF and altered levels of TIMP2 target MMP2in plasma; our preliminary data support a perturbation of TIMP2 metabolism in plasma in mouse models of ADpathology. We also find that TIMP2 expression decreases within dentate gyrus mossy cells important for theLTP response. In this work, we will probe the mechanism by which CNS TIMP2 directly regulates hippocampalfunction and the extent to which TIMP2 regulates hippocampal function in AD via changes in synaptic integrityas well as amyloid-? (A?)-dependent mechanisms. We hypothesize that TIMP2 regulates synaptic function inthe normal hippocampus and is restorative in the context of AD pathology, primarily by acting to maintainsynaptic integrity. We will address this hypothesis in three major aims: (1) To assess functional effects in micein which hippocampal TIMP2 has been targeted and to evaluate the contribution of its source in mossy cells toplasticity, (2) to assess the role of canonical and putative TIMP2 targets within the hippocampus, (3) and toinvestigate the role of TIMP2 and related pathways in amyloid-independent and amyloid-dependentmechanisms of AD pathology. Our aims will interrogate the function of TIMP2, a novel molecule with pro-plasticity roles in the hippocampus, having implications for development and creation of AD therapies.--Project Narrative: Aging; a strong risk factor for Alzheimer's disease; causes detrimental changes in thehippocampus; which is a key brain region responsible for learning and memory function. This proposalinvestigates how TIMP2; a protein revealed to be elevated in young blood; acts within the central nervoussystem to facilitate hippocampal synaptic function on a gene expression; cellular; and cognitive level in thecontext of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Creating insight into this mechanism will inform therapies targetingfacets of Alzheimer's disease; while also providing insights into how other secreted proteins within thehippocampus influence cognitive function.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Risks for developing cardiovascular?based and Alzheimer?s neurodegeneration (ND) are strongly connected toApolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms. There are three ApoE variants with differential impacts on ND risk, wherevariant 2 reduces and 4 increases risk relative to variant 3. These ApoE variants also impact cognition and memory inyoung healthy individuals, presumably through ApoE?s (primary) lipid transport function. Thus, a leading hypothesis isthat the transport of lipids creates a metabolic bias in healthy subjects that sensitizes (or protects) the brains of thesesubjects to physiological stresses which leads to ND. In support of this hypothesis, lifestyle choices including exercise anddiet, which shift metabolic patterns, modify the risk of ND as much as genetic predisposition. The interplay of geneticand environmental risk factors indicate that the preexisting metabolic condition of the brain is a key initiating variable,and that interceding in this metabolic bias represents a viable method for preventing disease. Unanswered questions,however, include which metabolic pathways are most impacted by the ApoE polymorphism, and how does ageexaggerate the metabolic condition to promote ND. Modified lipid metabolism is a unifying variable between long?term inflammation, reduced cellular repair and modified energy availability which all promote ND. We have developed methods to monitor the turnover of lipids and proteins in vivo. Coupling this with mass spectrometric (MS) imaging, we can see spatially distinct in vivo metabolic regulation across the brain. A systems?level investigation, in which the fluxes of many lipids and proteins are simultaneously measured, may be the most sensitive approach to monitor ApoE?dependent changes in regulation of metabolic networks. It is probable that the ApoE isoforms bias lipid delivery to different regions of the brain. This bias creates regional long?term shifts in metabolism, which change the risk for damage due to stress. Comparison of changes in brain metabolism between ApoE2, ApoE3, or E4 mouse models and the age?dependent changes for each genotype will help to identify metabolic patterns that protect the brain from accumulation of damage.The overall objective of this proposal is to monitor regional changes in metabolic pathway control and identify how ApoEshifts metabolic flux. The central hypothesis is that ApoE2 biases metabolism to a pattern that protects metaboliccontrol or regulation, while ApoE4 biases lipid metabolism in the opposite direction resulting in more rapid age?relatedloss of metabolic control.--This proposal develops new methods to identify how age and genetic factors modify brain metabolism and promote neurodegeneration. It is known that many risk factors change metabolism in specific regions of the brain; but how and why these changes occur is unknown.Identifying the region-specific metabolic consequences of known risk factors will allow us to design strategies to quantify risk and stop neurodegeneration before real damage is done.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Cancer chemotherapy causes marked cognitive impairment that involves deficits in learning & memory,attention, and executive functions. The best characterized genetic risk factor for chemotherapy inducedcognitive impairment (CICI) is the E4 allele of APOE, which is also the strongest genetic risk factor forAlzheimer?s disease (AD). This commonality of risk provides a powerful opportunity to define mechanisms ofthe effects of APOE4 on cognitive dysfunction across conditions. We have developed a mouse model ofAPOE4-related CICI showing strong chemotherapy-induced cognitive effects in the APOE4 mice but notAPOE3 mice, providing independent confirmation of this genetic risk in humans. We hypothesize thatchemotherapy induces CNS damages related to APOE functions. We are testing specific mechanisms ofAPOE4-related vulnerability in four specific aims: Aim 1: Determine how chemotherapy affects pathogenicprocesses of Alzheimer?s disease. We will use a mouse model of amyloid influenced by the different APOEalleles (EFAD mice), to define mechanisms of chemotherapy on AD pathogenesis. We will expose cohorts ofE3FAD and E4FAD mice to a chemotherapy regimen or vehicle control, and determine which AD pathologicalpathways are affected (A? levels, phospho-tau, microglial and astrocytic activation, neuronal and synaptic loss,and hippocampal atrophy). Aim 2: Define mechanisms of APOE4-related chemotherapy sensitivity in anon-AD model. The APOE4 knock-in mouse model allows testing for CNS alterations that may underlie CICIin cognitively healthy individuals. We will test CNS mechanisms already identified in relation to the APOE4genotype for exacerbation after chemotherapy, including: inflammation; neurogenesis; DNA damage; glialsenescence; blood brain barrier breakdown; and oxidative damage. Aim 3: Identify specific chemotherapiesassociated with lower risks of cognitive impairment. We will use our sensitive and reproducible APOE4mouse model to test whether some cancer chemotherapeutic approaches are safer than others. We will treatthe susceptible APOE4 mice with four of the common cancer chemotherapies with different mechanisms ofaction. Aim 4: Test therapeutic approaches to prevention of chemotherapy-induced cognitiveimpairments. Identification of APOE-related mechanisms allows the targeted identification of preventativeapproaches. We initially will test an agent for increasing lipidated APOE levels (bexarotene), and an anti-inflammatory agent (an antagonist of the receptor for advance glycation endproducts (RAGE)). Together, theseAims will identify mechanisms underlying the risk of CICI in the large portion of the population carrying theAPOE4 allele. In addition, the acute nature for the onset of CICI allows a more controlled approach for studyingthe negative effects of APOE4 in vivo, compared to only studying gradual processes of aging andneurodegeneration. Findings can be easily translated to clinical situations in terms of identifying at riskindividuals and in terms of identifying new APOE4-related biomarkers of cognitive impairment.--PROJECT NARRATIVEOne of the most debilitating side effects of cancer chemotherapy is cognitive impairment; including problemswith attention; learning & memory; and executive functions. We have found that this condition is particularlyprevalent in individuals who have inherited APOE4; which is also the strongest genetic risk factor forAlzheimer?s disease. The experiments here use a novel mouse model of chemotherapy-treated APOE4 miceto identify the molecular mechanisms behind this combined effect of APOE4 and chemotherapy; and to testwhether there are preventative treatments to reduce this condition in those undergoing treatment for cancer.\"},{\"abstract\":\"AbstractAging and carrying the APOE e4 allele are among the strongest risk factors for developing late-onset Alzheimer?sdisease (AD). Several lines of evidence reveal an increase in endosomal trafficking proteins in the brains ofAPOE e4 allele carriers decades before the onset of cognitive decline. However, there is a major gap in ourunderstanding of the critical mechanisms by which the ApoE4 protein regulates endosomal trafficking. Theactivity of the ATP binding cassette 1 (ABCA1) has an important role in the endocytosis of lipid-poor ApoE toinitiate its endosomal recycling. This facilitates lipidation of ApoE and its recycling into the extracellular space.Loss of ABCA1 activity increases lipid-poor and aggregated ApoE particles. In humans, genetic loss-of-functionmutations in ABCA1 are associated with increased AD risk. We hypothesize that aggregation of lipid-poor ApoE4is at the root of endosomal trafficking dysregulation, and that activation of ABCA1 to lipidate ApoE decreases itsaggregation and favors its endosomal recycling. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following threeSpecific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine the mechanisms of how ApoE and ABCA1 activity regulate endosomaltrafficking in primary astrocytes, neurons and microglia. In Aim 2, we determine the effect of aging, APOE4genotype and enhancing ABCA1 activity on ApoE aggregation and endosomal trafficking pathways in brains ofApoE targeted replacement mice, and in existing well-characterized human brain tissues that differ by APOEgenotype and cognitive state. In aim 3, we propose to develop an 18-F CS-6253 PET imaging modality to assessthe effect of APOE e4 and aging on ABCA1 brain activity in vivo. Achieving our aims will provide a detailedunderstanding of the effect of APOE4 on endosomal trafficking proteins, demonstrating a novel concept thatactivation of ABCA1 can ameliorate the congestion of ApoE4 containing endosomes. The information obtainedis of major significance to understanding early events that predispose to AD pathology and developingtherapeutic strategies focused on enhancing ABCA1 activity.--Aging and carrying the APOE e4 allele are the strongest risk factors for developing Alzheimer?sdisease (AD). There is good evidence identifying changes in brain endosomal proteins and ApoEaggregation as early events predisposing to AD pathology. However; there is a major gap in ourunderstanding of the mechanisms by which the ApoE4 protein regulates endosomal trafficking.In this project; we study how ApoE protein aggregates affect brain cellular functions in human andanimal tissues. We study whether inducing ABCA1 activity to make ApoE HDL can reduce ApoEaggregation and ameliorate the brain endosomal congestion observed with ApoE4.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Two causal mechanisms of neurodegeneration that are found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-relateddiseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) are re-initiation of the mitoticcell-cycle in neurons, and impaired nucleocytoplasmic trafficking resulting from disruptions in the nuclearenvelope (NE) and nuclear pore complex (NPC). Deeper insight into how these abnormalities arise would clarifyapproaches to design effective treatments for these diseases; however, very little is known about the initiatingmechanisms involved. This application will test the hypothesis that neuronal quiescence is maintainedthroughout life via active mechanisms that inhibit the mitotic cell-cycle and that re-initiation of the cell-cycle leadsto NE\\/NPC disassembly, a normal occurrence in mitotic cells. This hypothesis is based on our study of the six-transmembrane enzyme GDE2 (Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2; GDPD5), which cleaves the GPI-(Glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchor that tethers some proteins to the plasma membrane. GDE2 is a potentinhibitor of the mitotic cell-cycle and induces the differentiation of mitotic progenitors into post-mitotic neurons inthe developing nervous system. We discovered that in adult mice lacking GDE2 (Gde2 KO), cortical neuronsshow evidence of cell-cycle re-entry, suggesting that GDE2 is required to preserve neurons in a quiescent state.Strikingly, Gde2 KO neurons that have re-entered the cell-cycle show abnormal organization of the NE, aberrantdistribution of NPC proteins and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport, raising the possibility that cell-cycle re-initiation and NE\\/NPC breakdown are linked. Consistent with this idea, genetic reduction of cyclin D, a criticalregulator of the G1\\/S transition, suppresses nucleocytoplasmic transport-dependent neurodegeneration in aDrosophila model of c9ORF72 ALS-FTD. Notably, Gde2 KO mice display age-progressive neurodegenerationand GDE2 distribution and function is disrupted in AD patient neurons. These observations suggest thatmaintenance of neuronal quiescence is an active process and that failure of this process re-initiates the cell-cycle, triggers NE\\/NPC breakdown and induces neurodegeneration. Aim 1 will determine if GDE2 encodes anew pathway that maintains neuronal quiescence and will determine if neuronal cell-cycle re-entry signalsNE\\/NPC breakdown in neurons. Preliminary RNAseq, analysis of Wnt-reporter mice in Gde2 KOs, and geneticstudies in Drosophila identify aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling as a candidate pathway that inducesneuronal cell-cycle re-entry, NE\\/NPC breakdown and neurodegeneration. Aim 2 will utilize mouse andDrosophila models to test this hypothesis. Studies in Aim 3 will determine links between GDE2 dysfunction,neuronal cell-cycle re-entry and NE\\/NPC breakdown in disease using Drosophila models of AD and ADRD,human postmortem tissue and iPS human neurons. These studies will provide new molecular insight into cross-disease triggers of neurodegeneration important in human AD and ADRDs.--Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporaldementia (ALS-FTD) are incurable. Proposed studies will test function of GDE2 as a new pathway that preventsneuronal cell-cycle re-entry and nuclear envelope\\/nuclear pore complex breakdown; two causal mechanisms of neurodegeneration important in AD and ALS-FTD. Discoveries made will generate new understanding of disease mechanisms and have potential to identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Cognitive decline majorly affects quality of life in the general aging population; this is further exacerbated by anincreased risk for neurodegenerative diseases. The general age-related cognitive decline is thought to bemainly due to impaired synaptic function, not loss of neurons. Similarly, while neurodegenerative diseases doinvolve loss of neurons, there is also significantly impaired synaptic function in the surviving neurons, Forinstance, amyloid ? oligomers (A?) are major pathological agents in as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and causeacute impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, even at timepoints and concentrations insufficient to induce any significant neuronal cell death. Here we will test ourhypotheses that the LTP impairments related to normal aging versus AD (i) both involve mis-regulation of theCa2+\\/calmodulin(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), but (ii) by fundamentally different mechanisms to(iii) result in the distinct forms of LTP impairment in normal aging versus AD. Specifically, we hypothesize thatCaMKII hypo-nitrosylation directly causes the impairments in aging, but not the A?-induced impairments(which may instead even involve hyper-nitrosylation). Additionally, we hypothesize that hypo-nitrosylationreduces LTP by chronic long-term effects on synapse composition (including CaMKII itself), while the A? effectsinstead involve acute mis-regulation of CaMKII. LTP is well-known to require CaMKII and its Ca2+-independent ?autonomous? activity that is generated byautophosphorylation of T286. Additionally, two alternative ways to generate autonomous activity have beendescribed by my lab: Binding to the NMDA-receptor subunit GluN2B and S-nitrosylation of C280+C289. Indeed,CaMKII binding to GluN2B is also required for normal LTP and for the CaMKII movement to excitatory synapsesduring LTP. The functions of CaMKII nitrosylation in LTP and other forms of synaptic plasticity will be elucidatedhere. Intriguingly, previous studies have shown that aging is accompanied by hypo-nitrosylation of neuronalproteins, including CaMKII, in both mice and humans. Additionally, preliminary studies indicated thatnitrosylation causes CaMKII movement to excitatory synapses, and that this requires regulated CaMKII bindingto GluN2B. i.e. the same mechanism that is required for the LTP-induced CaMKII movement. In three related but independent aims, our proposal will determine the specific involvement of CaMKIInitrosylation in the LTP impairments related to normal aging versus AD (with the expectation for fundamentallydistinct CaMKII mis-regulation). First, we will determine the regulatory mechanisms for synaptic CaMKIIlocalization by nitrosylation. Then, we will determine the functions of CaMKII nitrosylation in the distinctimpairment of LTP related to normal aging versus AD. Finally, we will determine the effects of CaMKIInitrosylation on learning and memory function in behavioral tasks.--Higher brain functions such as learning; memory and cognition require synaptic plasticity; i.e. the controlledchanges in the strength of the connections between neurons. These functions require theCa2+\\/calmodulin(CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and are impaired both in normal aging and inAlzheimer's disease (AD); but to significantly different degrees. Preliminary studies indicate that theimpairment in normal aging versus AD both involve mis-regulation of CaMKII; but by completely differentmechanisms. These mechanisms will be tested further; with the ultimate goal to develop new therapeuticstrategies for improving different cognitive impairments seen in the aging population.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryNoradrenergic (NA) input to hippocampus from locus coeruleus (LC), the sole supplier of NA innervation toforebrain, is required for acquisition and consolidation of spatial learning and memory and contextual fearbehavior. The dentate gyrus (DG) contains the highest NA content, greatest NA fiber density, and largestexpression of ?1-and ?2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) in the hippocampal formation, consistent with DG being akey region of modulatory control by LC. There is a rich literature dating back to the mid 1980?s showing a criticalrole for ?-ARs in facilitating induction of both LTP and LTD at DG synapses depending upon the saliency of theexperience. This heightened plasticity occurs simultaneous with heightened learning and memory, and both areprevented by loss of NA innervation or pharmacological blockade of ?-ARs. Importantly, the LC in females hasa larger volume, LC neurons have greater dendritic arbors, and at proestrus, when plasma estradiol levels arethe highest, NA neuronal activity is decreased. The LC is the first brain region damaged in Alzheimer?s disease (AD), due to accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau). The consequence of this pathology is greatly under-appreciated since transgenic ADmouse models do not recapitulate this feature of human disease. Fortunately, the novel TgF344-AD rat modelhas significant p-tau accumulation in LC and NA axon loss in hippocampus, permitting detailed studies of LCand NA system dysfunction on hippocampal synaptic transmission and learning and memory. Clearly, identifyingstrategies to prevent p-tau accumulation and LC damage is critical. The post-translational modification, O-GlcNAcylation, has been shown to do just this through competition with phosphorylation at key serine residueson p-tau that cause its accumulation. Using brain slice electrophysiology, we reported pathologically heightenedLTP at medial perforant path synapses in dentate gyrus prior to CA1 synapses in both sexes. In recent data, wefind heightened potentiation at medial perforant path synapses following pharmacological activation of ?-ARs.This upregulation of ?-AR function in the context NA fiber loss likely drives the heightened LTP and masksdeficits in learning and memory early in the disease. The current proposal will test the hypothesis thathippocampal noradrenergic function in AD is impaired via aberrant excitability of LC-NA cells caused byprogressive p-tau accumulation and through NA denervation, both of which will be worse in ovariectomizedfemales and protected by O-GlcNAcylation. We will use a combination of electrophysiology in hippocampus andlocus coeruleus, hippocampus-dependent behavior, pharmacology, biochemistry, and O-GlcNAc biology to testthis innovative hypothesis. Outcomes will shed new light on the role of LC damage in AD, and will lay the groundwork for therapeutic strategies targeting the LC and perhaps O-GlcNAcylation.--Project NarrativeHyperphosphorylated tau accumulation in the locus coeruleus (LC); the sole source of noradrenergic innervationin hippocampus; is the earlies insult in Alzheimer?s disease (AD); and loss of hippocampal noradrenergicinnervation underlies cognitive deficits AD patients. We will use the novel TgF344-AD rat model to discover howLC damage alters hippocampal circuit function in a sex dependent way; and determine whether increasing thepost-translational modification O-GlcNAcylation protects the LC system during disease progression.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYCurrent therapies do not alter the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerativeillness that affects 5.8 million people in the United States and 44 million people worldwide. Thus, an urgentgoal for research is to identify points of control for neurodegeneration, which may be targeted to slow downAD progression. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that the enzyme N-AcylethanolamineAcid Amidase (NAAA) is one such focal point. NAAA is a lysosomal lipid hydrolase that convertspalmitoylethanolamide (PEA) into palmitate. PEA is an endogenous agonist of the neuroprotective nuclearreceptor PPAR-?, whereas palmitate promotes neurodegeneration by suppressing the transcription co-activator PGC1?, a key regulator of neuronal energy metabolism and survival. Preliminary experiments haveshown that NAAA transcription is abnormally elevated in persons with sporadic AD and in various animalmodels of neurodegeneration, including the 5xfAD model of AD. In the same models, we found thatpharmacological NAAA inhibition and\\/or genetic NAAA deletion exert marked protective effects. Based onthese results, we hypothesize that dysfunctions in NAAA-regulated lipid signaling may be criticallyinvolved in the pathogenesis of AD. We have three specific aims. Aim 1. Characterize NAAA-regulatedlipid signaling in mouse models of AD. Using 5xfAD and Tau P301S mice, two mouse lines that capturedistinct aspects of AD pathology, we will identify age-dependent, regionally selective changes in NAAA-regulated lipid signaling, which might precede and\\/or accompany neurodegenerative alterations andcognitive impairment. Aim 2. Determine the impact of pharmacological NAAA inhibition in mouse models ofAD. We will assess the impact of chronic administration of the compounds ARN19702 and ARN16186 ? twobrain-permeant NAAA inhibitors discovered by our team ? on molecular, morphological and behavioralmarkers of disease progression in 5xfAD and Tau P301S mice. Aim 3. Determine the impact of geneticNAAA deletion in mouse models of AD. Using our conditional NAAA-\\/- mice, we will generate NAAA-deficient 5xfAD and Tau P301S mice to evaluate the impact of NAAA deletion on disease progression. InAims 2 and 3, we will also explore molecular and cellular substrates for the effects of NAAAinhibition\\/deletion using single-cell RNA sequencing. The proposed studies will elucidate the functional rolesof NAAA-regulated lipid signaling in the pathogenesis of AD and, if our hypothesis is verified, will validateNAAA as a novel molecular target for the treatment of this disorder.--PROJECT NARRATIVEForty-seven million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide; but there is still no adequatetreatment for this devastating neurodegenerative illness. Our lab has recently discovered that persons withlate-onset AD; the most common form of this disease; express high levels of an enzyme called NAAA; andthat inhibiting the activity of this enzyme markedly attenuates neurodegeneration in a mouse model.

The proposed research will examinethe role of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) in modulating the neuroimmune response to ApoE-dependent amyloidpathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that activation of immunemediators is a critical regulator of AD pathology. However, the exact role that microglia play in modulating ADpathogenesis is still difficult to parse, partly due to discrepant effects of microglial function in models ofamyloidosis and tauopathy. Microglial response to amyloid and tau deposition is dependent on apolipoprotein E(ApoE) as evidenced by experiments where ApoE expression is genetically deleted. 25-HC is produced exclusivelyby microglia, is a potent modulator of microglial response, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmuneneurological disease and modulates the production of ApoE. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis thatmicroglial production of 25-HC modulates ApoE-dependent neuroinflammatory responses and neurodegeneration inmouse models of amyloid and tau deposition. Clarifying the role of 25-HC and ApoE in these processes will provideinsights into AD pathobiology and ultimately should point towards novel therapeutic targets that can be leveragedto treat AD and related dementias.

Synaptosomal MicroRNAs, Synaptic Damage and Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's DiseaseProject summary\\/abstract The purpose of our study is to determine the role of synaptosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in Alzheimer'sdisease (AD) progression and pathogenesis. Synapses are the most important compartments of neuron thatdeliver signals to adjacent neuron and maintain healthy synaptic functions of the brain. Synapse territories arecomposed of synaptic vesicles, synaptic proteins, mitochondria, neurotransmitters receptors, postsynapticdensity protein and localized small RNAs and miRNAs. Recently, several studies identified the miRNAsenrichments at synapse, synaptic vesicles and synaptosomes. However, the role of synapse-associatedmiRNAs in AD progression is completely unexplored. In the first part of our study, we will identify thesynaptosome-specific miRNAs that are deregulated in AD, and further, we will characterize their roles in ADprogression and pathogenesis. Synaptosomal fraction will be extracted from frontal cortex region ofpostmortem brains from AD (n=15) and healthy controls (n=15). Total RNA will be extracted fromsynaptosomal fraction and processed for miRNA and mRNA sequencing. The deregulated synaptosome-specific miRNAs will be characterized in vitro using miRNA mimics and inhibitor(s) approaches and mutantAPP and p-tau cDNA constructs. Impact of synaptosomal miRNAs will be studied against A? and p-tauinduced toxicities. In second part we will determine the role of synaptosomal miRNAs in A? induced synapticand cognitive dysfunction in AD. The impact of synaptosomal miRNAs will be studied on healthy neurons andAD neurons with A? induced toxicities. We will focus on neuronal processing, neuronal growth and networkdevelopment and synaptic plasticity using APP primary neuronal cultures. Alteration of synaptosomal miRNAsexpression and synaptic proteins will be studied with disease progression in APP transgenic (TG) and APPknockout (KO) mice. We will execute the synaptosome-specific miRNAs expression with various cognitivebehavioral and biochemical tests in 2-, 6-, 12- and 18-month-old APP TG and APP KO mice lines relative toage-matched TG negative wild-type (WT) mice. And in third part we will study the role of synaptosomalmiRNAs in phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) induced synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD.

Present study is designed to determine the status of synaptosomal and cytosolic miRNAs inAlzheimer's disease and to unveil their possible roles in amyloid-? and p-tau induced synaptic damage andcognitive dysfunction. The outcome of our study is expected to provide new insights about synaptosome-specific miRNAs and their therapeutic relevance in synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary Long-term potentiation (LTP) and other forms of synaptic plasticity are cellular correlates of learning andmemory. The Ca2+\\/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) facilitates LTP by translocating to stimulatedsynapses and phosphorylating local targets. LTP is impaired in global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and Alzheimer?sdisease (AD), two neurological disorders that demand effective treatment. GCI has acute and chronic effects:initially, it triggers excitotoxic neuronal cell death; long-term, it impairs LTP within the surviving neurons.Together, the neuronal loss and compromised synaptic plasticity underlie cognitive decline observed afterischemia, and an ideal therapy would target both. My proposed research aims to determine whether GCI-inducedLTP impairments utilize signaling pathways previously implicated in AD. The amyloid-? precursor protein (APP) is proteolytically cleaved to form amyloid-? peptide1-42 (A?).Exogenous application of A? impairs LTP and CaMKII synaptic enrichment in hippocampal neurons. How doesA? signal to disrupt CaMKII? Recent published work suggests that APP acts not only upstream of A? (as the A?precursor) but also downstream (as the A? receptor): A? association with APP was found to be required for LTPand memory impairments, as APP knockout (KO) prevented exogenous A?-induced deficits. While increasedAPP and A? are well-studied in AD pathology, a potential function for A?\\/APP signaling in ischemia has not beenfully elucidated. Studies from our lab indicate that GCI- and A?-induced reductions in LTP utilize a commonmechanism through CaMKII. To test the hypothesis that APP mediates the GCI-induced LTP impairment bydisrupting CaMKII signaling, I will test three specific aims: i) whether APP mediates A?-induced impairments inLTP and CaMKII synaptic translocation, ii) APP mediates GCI-induced LTP impairments, and iii) whether thetherapeutic window for protecting synaptic plasticity after GCI shows an extended range (days), even if thewindow for protecting neuronal cell death is much shorter (hours). This project will utilize acute hippocampalslices and cultures hippocampal neurons for biochemistry, slice electrophysiology, and live confocal microscopy.Imaging will employ FingR intrabodies that are designed to label endogenous proteins, including CaMKII? andpost-synaptic markers.

It is the most common cause of dementia, and its pathology includes extensive neuronal loss,accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (A?) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. A number oflarge scale meta-analyses of genome wide association studies (GWAS) has analyzed polymorphisms in manyhuman subjects, and identified more than 20 genes associated with AD risk, which can be classified based ontheir known functions: cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and endocytosis. Our lab seeks to utilize inducedpluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with familial and sporadic AD to understand the cellular mechanismsunderlying AD. My proposed project will investigate the potential convergent mechanisms of APOE and SORL1function in the brain. Both APOE and SORL1 are AD risk genes, and APOE (?4) is the strongest genetic riskfactor for AD. Not only is SORL1 a GWAS hit for late onset AD (LOAD), but recent studies identified SORL1loss-of-function variants in familial AD patients, suggesting that SORL1 can be a potential causal gene for AD.Here, I will study the function of SORL1 as a receptor for APOE, which can address the potential convergentmechanism between these genes. I hypothesize that SORL1 will function as an APOE receptor in humanastrocytes and regulate A? clearance. In support of this, publicly available RNA-seq data show that SORL1transcript is highly expressed in astrocytes over other brain cell types. In addition, APOE has a known role in A?clearance, and SORL1 is in the APOE receptor gene family. These findings, however, do not directly examinethe role of SORL1 in regulating A? uptake in astrocytes. Here, I will utilize iPSC-derived astrocytes with differentSORL1 and APOE variants to study the ability of SORL1 to function as an APOE receptor and uptake A?. In Aim1, I will generate iPSC-derived astrocytes and determine SORL1 expression, subcellular localization, and ligandbinding characteristics. Then, In Aim 2, I will use iPSC-derived astrocytes generated from individuals with 1)different APOE isoforms 2) SORL1 knock out (KO), risk SNPs and missense mutations and 3) other AD riskSNPs. I then will meticulously characterize A? generation, uptake and clearance in these astrocytes. Ourpreliminary data suggest that SORL1 is highly expressed in human astrocytes, and SORL1 KO in theseastrocytes results in elevated extracellular A? levels. Also, I have shown that iPSC-derived astrocytes reduceextracellular A? levels when treated with exogenous A?, opening up the possibility\\/potential for this assay toexamine the A? clearance ability of cells from individuals with various genetic backgrounds. In summary, myproposal will utilize iPSC-derived astrocytes to examine the novel role of SORL1 as an APOE receptorin astrocytes, and investigate a potential convergent mechanism that APOE and SORL1 play in A?clearance.--Project NarrativeWhile numerous genetic studies have identified more than 20 genes linked to increasing the risk of developingAlzheimer?s disease (AD); the mechanistic link between these genes and amyloid-beta (A?) accumulation in thebrain is yet unclear. Interestingly; APOE; the strongest genetic risk factor for AD; is a gene involved in generatinglipoproteins that can directly interact with A? and regulate clearance of A?; and SORL1; another AD risk gene;belongs to a family of proteins that can mediate this clearance of A?. My work aims to investigate the novel roleof SORL1 in human astrocytes by examining its role in mediating A? clearance.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is characterized by both, an accumulation of extracellular Amyloid-? (A?) plaques andintracellular tau tangles. The highest genetic risk factor for developing late-onset AD is Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)isoform ?4. In humans there are three ApoE isoforms: ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 that vary by one or two aminoacids. ApoE4 impairs vesicular trafficking, resulting in synaptic dysfunction which occurs years before ADsymptoms and pathology develop, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the accelerated disease onset inApoE4 carriers. We have shown that the ApoE4-mediated synaptic defect is alleviated by acidifying the earlyendosomal pH with either a pharmacological block or genetic ablation of the Sodium\\/Hydrogen Exchanger (NHE)6. This significant finding implicates NHE6 inhibition as a potential therapy for preventing AD in ApoE4 carriers.In order to move forward towards developing NHE6 inhibitor drugs, it is critical to evaluate how NHE6 inhibitionalters AD pathology. Thus, we created an NHE6 knockout (NHE6-KO) mouse and bred it with an A? producingmouse model. Remarkably, A? plaque deposition is reduced by NHE6 depletion in vivo, further implicating NHE6inhibition as a promising target for delaying AD. In this proposal, I will delineate the molecular mechanism behindthe reduced plaque deposition that occurs with NHE6 ablation. Depletion of NHE6 in vivo results in an increasein glial activation, thus I hypothesize that the increased glial activation in NHE6-KO mice promotes thedegradation of A?. Currently, the effects of early endosomal acidification on glial activation and A? clearancefrom the CNS has not been explored. The goal of this study is to determine if acidification of early endosomesin glial cells is detrimental or whether increased A? clearance is predominantly protective. In addition, it is crucialto investigate whether NHE6 inhibition in microglia causes an over-activated immune response. Thus, I willdetermine if NHE6-KO microglia induces a heightened immune response to bacterial or viral insult. Lastly, in thisproposal I will investigate if NHE6-KO in microglia alone can reduce A? pathology and whether treatments withNHE inhibitors in the brain can enhance A? clearance in vivo using reverse microdialysis. Overall, the long-termgoal for this grant is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of targeting NHE6 as a treatment for AD by using invitro and in vivo methods.--Currently approximately 44 million people worldwide are diagnosed with Alzheimer?s or a related dementia. Thisproposal investigates a novel approach to prevent Alzheimer?s disease by increasing the acidity of theendolysosomal system and thereby promoting the removal of amyloid from the brain.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACTApolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Individualswho possess one or more copies of the APOE4 variant have an increased risk of developing AD, with anearlier age of onset and more rapid cognitive decline, compared to those with the more common APOE3 allele.ApoE is expressed primarily in astrocytes, and secreted on lipoprotein particles to provide cholesterol andunsaturated phospholipids for membrane expansion and synapse formation in neurons. However, little isknown regarding the basic molecular mechanisms behind ApoE function in astrocytes, and how the E4 variantpromotes disease. I have discovered that ApoE can traffic either to the secretory pathway or to cytoplasmiclipid droplets in astrocytes. My central hypothesis is that ApoE can be stimulated to target lipid droplets in thecytoplasm rather than being secreted, and that it is involved in promoting the storage of neutral lipids withinlipid droplets. I also hypothesize that the lipid droplet function of ApoE is altered in the disease-associated E4and E2 variants. To test this hypothesis, I will perform structure-function studies to determine which regions ofthe protein are necessary for ApoE to target the cytoplasmic compartment and localize to lipid droplets. I willexamine how ApoE trafficking is controlled by neuronal signals by performing astrocyte-neuron cocultureassays. To determine the function of ApoE targeted to lipid droplets, I will use shRNA to knockdown ApoE andobserve the effect on the distribution of neutral lipids in the cell. I will then determine whether ApoE regulateslipid droplet biogenesis, growth, or turnover via fluorescent lipid pulse-chase assays coupled with time-lapsemicroscopy and automated image analysis. I will compare the trafficking and function of the different variantsof ApoE to test whether the lipid droplet function is altered in E2 and E4.

In general, confirmatorydiagnosis of AD involves both pathological hallmarks (such as plaques and tangles) as wellas clinically observed cognitive decline. Whereas most cases of patients with AD pathologyshow cognitive and clinical phenotypes, a subset of individuals have pathology suggestive ofAD without the corresponding cognitive impairment. One possible explanation is that these?resistant? individuals have compensatory mechanisms protecting their cognitive status fromthe presence of pathology. Recent work from single-nucleus RNA-sequencing on post-mortem human frontal cortex tissue suggests molecularly distinct subsets of astrocytes (anon-neuronal cell type in the brain) are differentially present in ?resistant? versus?susceptible? (cognitively declined with pathology) individuals. However, this observation sofar has been limited to a single brain region in a small sample of primarily Caucasianindividuals. This proposal aims to corroborate and extend this finding by investigatingastrocyte subpopulations, their molecular profiles, and their associations with other cell typesin multiple regions of the brain in an ethnically diverse. Through a combination of single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and systemsbiology, we propose to create a map of the differential distribution of astrocytesubpopulations in ?resistant? and ?susceptible? individuals, their spatial relation to pathologyand other cell types, and candidate genes and pathways that involved in astrocyte-mediatedresistance to tau pathology. Ultimately, characterizing the association between specificastrocyte subpopulations, their interactions, and pathways involved in resistant individualsmay identify therapeutic avenues to mitigate cognitive decline in the presence of ADpathology.--Project NarrativeWhereas Alzheimer's Disease (AD); a progressive neurodegenerative disease; generallymanifests in cognitive decline and brain pathology in the form of plaques and tangles; asubset of aged individuals show AD-like pathology without the corresponding cognitivedecline.

Ageing in mice and human is associated with the increasedexpression of pro-inflammatory genes in microglia and microglia pro-inflammatory activation is considered oneof the causes of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease. The age-associatedincrease in microglia-driven inflammation is linked to an aberrantly heightened response of microglia todifferent inflammatory stimuli. The enhanced state of microglia activation during ageing resembles the state oftrained immunity where initial immune cell exposure to various pro-inflammatory causes quantitate andqualitative long-lasting changes in cell responses to environmental triggers. We hypothesize that increasedpro-inflammatory activity of microglia reflects the history of microglia exposure to inflammatory signals duringanimal or human life. We argue that infectious diseases, many of which can occur early in life, and theaccompanied systemic inflammation exposes microglia to periphery-derived pro-inflammatory signals.Exposure to pro-inflammatory triggers can leave an epigenetic imprint that drives heightened inflammatorygene expression in ageing microglia. To test this hypothesis, we will induce transient systemic inflammation inmice followed by the analysis of gene expression at differed ages. The long-lasting changes in geneexpression that follow innate immune cell activation has been previously linked to the activation of latentenhancers. We propose to determine the activation state of microglia enhancers after initial activation followedby the lifelong monitoring of the enhancer activity. We demonstrated that treatment of microglia withpharmacological inhibitors of BET proteins, that play a prominent role in enhancer activity, leads to the potentsuppression of microglia activation in vitro and in vivo. Most notably, treatment with BET inhibitors has a majortherapeutic impact on mice that suffer from AD. We will address the specific contribution of individual BETproteins to pro-inflammatory gene expression and enhancer activation during ageing and inneurodegeneration. This information is highly relevant for our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms thatgovern the systemic age-associated microglial inflammatory state and may lead to the development of novelapproaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.--Project NarrativeAgeing is a major risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases and is associated with the systemic activation ofan inflammatory microglia state. We propose to address the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the enhancedpro-inflammatory activity of microglia in the ageing brain and its contribution to neurodegeneration Our studieswill establish a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic approaches against neurodegeneration bytargeting epigenetic regulators of inflammation by microglia.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryGradual loss of brain function and neurodegeneration are common features of aging throughout diverse phyla.Understanding how the central nervous system (CNS) regenerates neurons throughout its life is a major area ofinterest in regenerative medicine. The study of neural stem cells (NSC) and CNS development and biology hasbeen an active field of research, however, our knowledge of the precise developmental programs that regulateNSC dynamics during aging is limited due to the rarity of long term NSCs, the difficulty of monitoring NSCs in-vivo, and the incredible complexity of mouse and human brains. In this proposal we seek to understand basicprinciples and evolutionary conserved elements of neuronal regeneration, degeneration and aging usingBotryllus schlosseri, a primitive chordate with a simple CNS that exhibits assayable and frequent (weekly) CNStissue regeneration and degeneration throughout adult life, that can be monitored in vivo thanks to its nearlytransparent body. These organisms can reproduce either sexually through gametes, or asexually through a stemcell mediated budding process. As a new generation of buds develop into mature individuals (zooids) the bodiesof the old zooids undergo a synchronized wave of programmed cell death. During this weekly regeneration anddegeneration cycle new brains form within the young buds in concert with the destruction of the old zooids? brain(Fig 1). This model system offers a unique opportunity to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms that directweekly cycles of CNS generation and degeneration in young and old colonies (e.g. &lt;3 months vs. >9 years) andto identify mutations that accumulate in the DNA of its CNS, stem cells that persist throughout its life. TheBotryllus genome encodes hundreds of brain-associated genes with mammalian homologs. We have undertakena systematic molecular (transcriptomic), cellular (FACS) morphological and behavioral characterization of oldand young colonies (Fig 2). Botryllus transcriptome analyses revealed 393 genes that correlate with Alzheimer?sdisease are differentially expressed between young and old colonies (Fig 2C-D). Blood analysis showed anincreased frequency of phagocytic cells in old Botryllus colonies (Fig 2A-B), analogous to the age-associatedshift in mouse and human HSC to favor myeloid cells. Morphological and functional analysis found that the brainsof old colonies are smaller, contain a lower number of cells and have reduced response to stimuli (Fig 2E-F).Since stem cells are the only cells that self-renew and are maintained throughout the colony?s life, wehypothesize that genetic mutations that accumulate over time in NSC are the main cause of age associatedneurodegenerative diseases. To test this hypothesis, we plan to characterize the molecular and cellular diversityof the Botryllus brain in young and old colonies, isolate its NSCs, identify mutations that accumulate in NSC andprogenitor cells DNA, and test their effect on brain regeneration and function.--Project NarrativeReduction in the brain?s functional ability is a common symptom of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Inthis proposal we will use a unique long-lived invertebrate model organism that regenerates a new brain eachweek and ages over years; to study the stepwise genetic changes that accumulate in its brain cells throughoutlife; and to test the effect of these changes on brain function.

The core pathology in DLB is progressivepathologic accumulation of misfolded ?-synuclein in Lewy bodies that especially targets midbrain dopamine (DA)neurons and leads to their degeneration. This neuronal loss in response to synucleinopathy is an importantsource of vulnerability not only in DLB, but is also found in Alzheimer?s disease. Given the shared features acrossdisorders, identifying mechanisms of DA neurodegeneration in response to synucleinopathy may providecritical insights into neuron vulnerability and resilience common to age-related neurodegenerativedisorders. However, we still lack basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuronal vulnerability andresilience. Significantly, we have established complementary approaches comparing Drosophila and mousemodels of age-related neurodegenerative disease. We exploit the similarities and differences between the twospecies to provide novel insights into evolutionarily conserved cellular and molecular pathways that affect age-related neurodegeneration. Using these approaches, we have identified the vesicular glutamate transporterVGLUT (VGLUT2 in mammals and dVGLUT in Drosophila) as a new modulator of resilience toneurodegeneration in DA neurons. Indeed, DA neurons that upregulate VGLUT expression are more resilientincluding in response to pathologic accumulation of ?-synuclein ? a conserved response in flies and mice. Toelucidate VGLUT?s roles in DA neuron vulnerability, we established an innovative suite of intersectional genetictools to selectively distinguish and manipulate DA neurons that express VGLUT in flies and mice. With thesetools and models, we can now answer key questions: 1) what are the conserved mechanisms regulatingexpression of DA neuron VGLUT in synucleinopathy? and 2) do regulators of VGLUT expression modulateresilience to neurodegeneration caused by synucleinopathy? To address this, we take advantage of the fly?sgenetic tractability to rapidly identify new targets of vulnerability and resilience and then test these candidates inmouse models of synucleinopathy. Our central hypotheses are: i) DA neuron VGLUT expression is under tightregulatory control and the genes involved are critical for VGLUT upregulation in synucleinopathy (Aim 1). ii)Upregulation of VGLUT expression is a pro-survival coping mechanism and the genes that modulate thisincreased VGLUT expression in DA neurons contribute to resilience in synucleinopathy (Aim 2). Using ourcomparative approaches, we may identify novel interventional targets conserved across species to boostresilience in DA neurons. These new targets may ultimately be tested in other cell types as a broader interventionfor prevention, mitigation and treatment of neurodegeneration in DLB, Alzheimer?s disease and Alzheimer?sdisease-related dementias.--Degeneration and dysfunction of midbrain dopamine neurons is an important feature of several age-relatedneurodegenerative disorders including dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer?s disease.

In this application,we use Drosophila to demonstrate that progressive neurotoxicity elicited by Tau or hexanucleotide repeatexpansion of C9ORF72 involves elevated production of the second messenger, inositol trisphosphate (IP3), andactivation of IP3 receptor (IP3R)-mediated ER Ca2+ release. Thus, premature lethality stemming from expressionof ADRD-causing transgenes was almost fully suppressed by attenuation of IP3 production or knockdown IP3Rs.Although IP3Rs have been previously implicated in neurodegeneration, we have uncovered a novel mechanismunderlying channel hyperactivation. We show expression of ADRD-causing transgenes leads to loss of neuronalmembrane potential, and that the resulting depolarization is what increases IP3R activity. Our preliminary findingsare consistent with the notion that depolarization increases association of an enzyme responsible for IP3production, phospholipase Cb (PLCb), with its phosphoinositide substrate, PIP2. Greater PLCb?PIP2 interactionsin depolarized cells lead to elevated IP3 production upon stimulation of PLCb-coupled receptors. In Aim 1, wewill test the aforementioned hypothesis in fly and mouse neurons expressing mutant tau. We also ask how ADRDneurons lose their ability to maintain membrane potential. Based on electrophysiological recordings and analysesof RNA-seq datasets, we hypothesize that chronic depolarization stems from diminished abundance of neuronalK+ leak channels that are needed for establishing normal resting membrane potential. In Aim 2, we seek todetermine how depolarization potentiates PLCb?IP3R signaling. Our findings suggest that membrane potentialdependent regulation of PLCb?PIP2 association and hydrolysis depend on the lipids? acyl side chains. Taken inconjunction with our findings that depolarization promotes IP3 production, we hypothesize that PLCb activitydepends on PIP2 side chain identity, and increases in depolarized cells due to the preferential hydrolysis ofspecies with longer and more unsaturated side chains. Successful completion of the proposed studies woulddemonstrate that IP3R hyperactivation in ADRD neurons is agnostic to the causal mutations ? an insight thatspeaks to the wide applicability of our findings. We also hope to develop strategies that can be leveraged toselectively change the population of PIP2 species at the plasma membrane in order to correct pathological Ca2+dyshomeostasis that occurs in ADRD.--PROJECT NARRATIVEAccumulation of neurofibrillary tangles comprised of Tau; or mutations in the gene encoding this protein; arecommon in Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD).

It is a shared major pathological hallmark in many neurodegenerative diseases (ND), includingAlzheimer?s disease (AD), Huntington?s disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Excitotoxicity ismostly mediated by the activation of the NMDA-type of glutamate receptors (NMDARs). However, the NMDARfunction is indispensable for normal neuronal function. This conundrum is explained by the fact that NMDARsare segregated in two populations: synaptic (sNMDARs) and extrasynaptic (exNMDARs). While sNMDARs arelinked to pro-survival signaling, over-activation of exNMDARs triggers excitotoxicity. Therefore, exNMDAR areobvious pharmacological targets in a broad range of ND and, in fact, blocking NMDAR activity stronglyameliorates cognitive defects in AD and HD mouse models. However, selective inhibition of exNMDARs ischallenging, and the vast majority of NMDAR antagonists have failed in clinic due to side effects mediated bysNMDAR blockade. We propose to test a novel therapeutic strategy based on the fact that s- and exNMDARsare not independent populations. On the contrary, s- and exNMDARs pools are physiologically connected vialateral diffusion. We hypothesize that shifting the s\\/exNMDAR balance towards synaptic expression would bebeneficial two-folds (i) promoting survival cascades (sNMDAR-mediated) and (ii) decreasing pro-death signaling(exNMDAR-mediated). We are ideally suited to test this strategy because we have previously identified severalof the mechanisms controlling s\\/exNMDAR balance. Those include different protein interactions with theGluN2B-subunit of NMDARs and a particular phosphorylation on GluN2B (at S1480) that promotes sNMDARclearance and receptor stabilization at extrasynaptic sites. The goal of this proposal is to validate the proof-of-principle that reducing excitotoxicity by preventing sNMDAR clearance and\\/or promoting exNMDAR reinsertioninto synaptic sites is an effective therapeutic strategy in ND. In Aim 1, we will evaluate novel molecular tools tomodulate s\\/exNMDAR balance in culture and in vivo, including (i) small interfering peptides (sIPs) and (ii)pharmacology to modulate GluN2B phosphorylation. Our study includes the repurposing of an anti-tumoral drugcurrently in phase 1\\/2 of clinical trial. Also, we will use proteomics to compare the posttranslational modificationprofile of s- vs. exNMDARs, aiming to identify novel mechanisms regulating the balance. In Aim 2, we willevaluate the suitability of this strategy as a common therapeutic strategy in ND. First, we will test the efficacy ofour tools in ameliorating excitotoxicity-mediated pathological outcomes in several models of AD, both in cultureand in vivo. Finally, we will use our strategy in primary cultures from models of HD (associated by excitotoxicity)and Parkinson?s disease (excitotoxicity is not a primary pathomechanism). If successful, this proposal, based onreducing excitotoxicity by regulating NMDAR trafficking but not by inhibiting NMDAR function, will have agroundbreaking translational impact on the identification of innovative therapeutics for a wide range of ND.--This proposal seeks to validate an innovative therapeutic strategy potentially applicable to a broad spectrum ofneurodegenerative disorders based on modulating the localization of NMDA Receptors (NMDARs) within thesynapse. Because the activation of NMDARs located at the synaptic sites (sNMDARs) triggers pro-survivalintracellular cascades whereas the overactivation of extrasynaptically located NMDARs (exNMDARs) is toxic for the neuron (excitotoxicity); we propose to interfere with the molecular mechanisms that control NMDARlocalization to promote sNMDAR expression and decrease exNMDAR expression. If successful; this novelapproach will contribute to reducing the burdens of illness and disability of many patients because excitotoxicity has been associated with Alzheimer?s and Huntington?s diseases; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Multiple Sclerosis; among other neuropathies.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Human clinical trials have failed to produce a disease modifying drug for treating late onset Alzheimer?sdisease (AD) and ineffectual animal models are partly to blame. Our proposal addresses the large unmet needto produce an animal model of AD which will both increase our understanding of this disease as well asprovide a model for pre-clinical drug testing. Unlike past models that relied on over expression of mutantgenes from artificial promoters, we have used homologous recombination to create double and triple knock in(KI) mice using human genes that play a large role in AD. Current strategies also do not incorporate aging intheir models which leaves out the single most important non-genetic risk factor in AD. In addition to aging weare adding chronic exposure to a Western diet (another prominent risk factor in AD) to our mouse modelswhich also addresses the multifactorial nature of AD that is sorely lacking from current models.

Theseresults prompted us to extend both the dietary exposure and age at sacrifice which make up our two aims: Aim1: Determine whether lifelong HFD exposure is sufficient to produce characteristics of AD in the double KIanimal models, Aim 2: Determine whether lifelong HFD exposure is sufficient to produce characteristics of ADin the triple KI animal models. All of our models will be exposed to a Western diet from 2-18 (and 24) months ofage, then phenotyped for biomarkers of AD (i.e. amyloid beta, abnormal tau, gliosis and neurodegeneration).We also plan to examine the brain lipid profile of these mice as preliminary data show deficiencies in essentialfatty acids in the APOE4 mice. Thus, the hypothesis we plan to test is that APOE4 carriers are at increasedrisk for AD due to insufficient uptake of essential fatty acids required for maintaining neuronal health. Mostimportantly, if our ideas are correct, we will have produced an invaluable model of AD that the entire researchcommunity can use to develop new treatments for AD.--In order to identify new drugs for treating AD it is critical that pre-clinical researchers have an accurate modelto runs tests. Our proposal intends to produce a more accurate model of AD which should increase thesuccess of translating novel drugs from the testing phase to human clinical trials.

With respect to mechanismsunderlying T2DM-associated systemic IR, there is overwhelming evidence for the role of ceramide(Cer), in particular C16-Cer generated from altered sphingolipid (SPL) metabolism. Ourpreliminary studies show increased levels of this ceramide species along with the enzyme thatproduces it i.e., ceramide synthase-6 (CerS6) in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD,PDAPP Tg (J-20) as well as type-2 diabetic wild-type mice.

Since immune cells and brain fattyacids are modifiable through diet and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake appears to affect the progressionof AD, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop one specific n-6 PUFA docosapentaenoic acid (DPAn-6) asa promising new lipid modulator acting on multiple targets in AD. We hypothesize that DPAn-6 modulates TGF?and insuling\\/IGF signaling pathway to improve immune cellular function and insulin resistance for treating ADpathologies and protecting neurons cognition. DPAn-6 is derived from n-6 precursor linoleic acid. Our rationaleis based on our extensive preliminary data, epidemiological and clinical studies. we found that oral DPAn-6reduced A\\u00c3\\u009f plaques, neuroinflammation, microgliosis, astrogliosis and apoptosis. In addition, it increases A?autoantibodies, nerve growth factor, BDNF and NPTX2, improving cognitive deficits in old E4FAD mice. Highlinoleic acid diet inhibited CD4+ T cell brain invasion and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), the target of nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Recently, emerging studies report that lower intake n-6 linoleic acid isassociated with risk of cognitive decline in aging patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment. However, theunderlying therapeutic targets and mechanisms are unknown. This proposal will also fill in a knowledge gap of the impact of n-6 PUFAs on AD. n-6 PUFAs have notbeen well-studied in AD. N-6 arachidonic acid (ARA) is a substrate for COX1 and COX2 that producesprostaglandins, the important mediators for inflammation. Thus, we pursue two specific aims in this proposalusing EFAD and APOE-TR AD mice. Aim 1 is to determine whether DPAn-6 modulates TGF? \\/Smad signalingpathway to boost immunity and treat AD neuropathological ?positive? and ?negative? lesions, and thus improvingcognitive deficits in APOE AD models. Aim 2 is to determine the neuroprotective role of DPAn-6 in reducinginsulin resistance by modulating insulin\\/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling pathway. We will alsoinvestigate a synergistic effect of a combination of DPAn-6 with n-3 DHA in old EFAD mice. This proposal is innovative and significant because it is based on initial evidence that DPAn-6 modulatesTGF? and insulin\\/IGF signaling pathways to enhance immunity for treating AD pathologies, protecting neuronsand improving cognitive deficits in old E4FAD mice. If our aims are achieved, we will develop DPAn-6 as a novellipid modulator for treating AD that can be readily moved to a clinical trial since it is safe, potent, and can betaken up by brain. Thus, DPAn-6 is a strong but unexplored new candidate for AD intervention. We will alsoelucidate the protective mechanisms of linoleic acid in epidemiology, in which the LA effect is explained by itsmetabolite DPAn-6.--Project Narrative This project is built on epidemiological; clinical trials and our novel findings to develop docosapentaenoicacid (DPAn-6) as a new preventive and therapeutic lipid treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our currentfindings reveal that oral DPAn-6 rapidly boosts immune function to reduce multiple AD patologies includingamyloid (A?) deposits and neuroinflammation; protects neurons and improves cognitive decline in old AD mousemodels with APOE4 genes. It is expected that the proposed studies will elucidate the immuno- andneuroprotective mechanisms of the inexpensive and natural product of DPAn-6 for improving public health; whichis alreadly proven safe in humans and therefore could quickly be moved to clinical trials.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY \\/ ABSTRACTAlzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting 3?11% of the United States elderly.On the other hand, the estimated incidence of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-induced mental disability ordisease is 10 per 1000 live births. Although theoretically PAE-induced mental diseases are preventable, theprevalence of PAE has been reported to be as high as 10%-16.3%. Among a broad spectrum of PAE and AD-associated symptoms, progressive impairment of cognition has been extensively investigated. However, limitedsymptomatic relief in these patients by available medications demonstrates lack of understanding of the neuronalsubstrates, especially the PAE and\\/or AD-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs). It is well accepted thatapathy, the top ranked NPS in both PAE and AD, arises through interactions between genetic and environmentalfactors. PAE has been considered an environmental insult to the brain and AD high risk genes have beenidentified as top genetic factors facilitating the onset of NPSs. Together with the increased life expectancy by 8-10 years in the USA in the last 50 years, the evaluation of interactions between PAE history and AD high-riskgenes at the molecular, synaptic, circuit, and behavioral levels is highly urgent. Ca2+permeable(CP)-AMPARs inthe nucleus accumbens (NAc) are hypothesized as the potential substrate in mediating the synaptic loss and thelow motivation phenotype in subjects with high risk of AD and a history of PAE. In this proposal, three SpecificAims are designed to first evaluate, and then modify, synaptic CP-AMPARs (Aim1) and excitatory synapticcontacts (Aim 2) in the NAc, and motivation levels (Aim 3) in F344 wild type vs. transgenic AD rats at theadolescent, early adult and middle-aged stages. Our hope is to not only fill the gap in our understanding ofneuronal mechanisms of apathy associated with AD and PAE, but also uncover novel neurobiological targets inthe clinic to treat affected patients.--PROJECT NARRATIVEApathy; as one of the top ranked symptoms of both Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and maternal alcohol consumption;has been understudied but significantly affects the life of patients and caregivers. The goal of this project is touncover a potential novel target; an atypical excitatory receptor in the nucleus accumbens; a brain regionassociated with motivational output; in those prenatally exposed to alcohol and also having high risk for AD. Thismay significantly improve the life quality of AD patients; decrease caregiver burden; lower the cost of care; andminimize premature institutionalization.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Although glia, the non-neuronal cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in aging and neurodegenerative disease, we know very little about how these cells interact with neurons during aging. Neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by aggregated misfolded proteins, which can cause cell death and dysfunction. Cells have developed systems to detect and fix these problems in a cellular compartment-specific manner; however, these responses to protein misfolding start to fail as organisms age. We have previously shown that neurons send out signals to alert other cells when they experience protein toxicity and stress, which could be a clue towards how the body could naturally fix protein misfolding in neurodegenerative disease. However, no one has yet investigated how glia respond to protein stress in the cytosolic compartment of the cell.  Our laboratory previously showed that neuronal over-expression of the main regulator of the cytosolic unfolded protein response, heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), is able to signal to distal cells to increase healthy protein folding effectors and help organisms live longer. Here, we propose that glial cells can also signal the heat shock response to coordinate a pan-organismal response and promote longevity (Aim 1). Our approach in this aim takes advantage of the genetic tractability, short lifespan, and simple imaging of the model organism, C. elegans, to study non-cell autonomous signaling between tissues in aging.  To further address the role of glia in rescuing neurons from protein toxicity, we will examine microglia in the mammalian brain. Here, we ask whether healthy microglia can rescue neurons stressed with tau protein misfolding, which is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and whether aged microglia might be defective in their aid to neurons. We will assess how microglia surveil the internal protein homeostasis of neurons (Aim 2). To do this, we will take advantage of transcriptome analysis, inducible mouse disease models, and rapidly improving cell culture methods.  Data generated through this proposal will shed new light on how the brain deals with protein stress and will identify novel signaling mechanisms of glial cells that will improve our understanding of neurodegenerative disease pathology.--Glial-neuronal interactions underlie a broad range of aging-associated disease phenotypes in the nervous system and beyond. Activation of the heat shock response (HSR) has been shown to extend lifespan and promote healthy aging; but until this proposal; glial signaling of the HSR has never been examined. This proposal studies the mechanism by which glial stress response induction can extend lifespan; and further proposes extending this work using microglia\\/neuronal interaction in tauopathies to interrogate the ways in which microglia signal aging-related stress responses to protect neurons.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Reactive astrocytes (RAs) are a feature of normal aging and neurodegeneration. RAs drastically change their morphology and gene expression, notably increasing the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in response to injury or inflammation. GFAP is the major intermediate filament protein of mature astrocytes. Autosomal dominant mutations in GFAP cause the rare and fatal leukodystrophy, Alexander disease (AxD). In AxD patients, astrocytes accumulate pathological GFAP aggregates (Rosenthal fibers; RFs) and become reactive. However, the mechanisms linking >70 different GFAP mutations to RF formation and other disease-relevant phenotypes in AxD remain unknown. My extensive preliminary data show that aberrant phosphorylation promotes GFAP aggregation, and that this modification is a marker of AxD severity, independently of the disease mutation. Further, I show that site-specific GFAP phosphorylation is associated with increased proteolysis by caspase-6, but whether the two are directly linked is unknown. I hypothesize that coordinated crosstalk between casein kinase (CK2) and caspase-6 promotes defective GFAP proteostasis to exacerbate the reactive phenotype of AxD astrocytes. For the F99 phase, I propose to use pharmacological and genetic strategies to inhibit CK2 and caspase-6 activity in order to characterize their roles in vitro using the astrocyte model that I developed (Aim 1.1), and in vivo utilizing an AxD mouse model (Aim 1.2). I will master iPSC gene editing with CRISPR\\/Cas9 to generate CK2 and caspase-6 knockouts and iPSC handling and differentiation to astrocytes and neurons (Aim 1.1), and I will apply these techniques to my postdoctoral project (Aim 2). For the K00 phase, I will investigate the functions of RAs in Alzheimer's disease in the lab of Dr. Mel Feany. Proteoglycans (PGs) are among the most highly upregulated genes in aging and RAs. Preliminary data from Dr. Feany's lab identified genetic interactions between PGs and models of neurodegeneration in the fly. I hypothesize that RAs produce an imbalance of PGs in the extracellular matrix, which creates an environment that is inhibitory to neuronal growth and remodeling. To model the mechanical changes known to occur in AD brain, I will develop a novel model to study RAs by culturing iPSC-astrocytes on substrates of different stiffness. Additionally, I will generate knockouts of candidate PGs in iPSCs and differentiate them to reactive and non-reactive astrocytes. I will use in vivo fly models and co-cultures of iPSC-astrocytes and neurons to examine the role of PGs in toxicity of RAs. My thesis project and my future postdoctoral studies will provide a rich training experience that will prepare me for a career as an independent investigator leading a rigorous research program at the nexus of aging and glial biology.--Reactive astrocytes are common features of neurodegenerative diseases and normal aging; but their role is still poorly understood and can encompass both beneficial and harmful effects. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that lead to astrocyte activation and defining the heterogeneity of astrocyte activation will lead to novel astrocyte-targeted therapies. This training proposal aims to understand the causes and effects of astrocyte reactivity in the context of Alexander disease (Aim 1) and aging and neurodegeneration (Aim 2).\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACTAging is the biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). However, theunderlying molecular mechanism that link mechanisms of aging to ADRDs are unknown. To developgeroprotectors, drugs that target aging and could be used to treat ADRDs we developed a neuro-centricgeroscience platform to identify Gero-Neuro-Protectors (GNP), geroprotectors that extend lifespan andsimultaneously protect neurons from multiple age associated toxicities. GNPs should make ideal treatmentsfor ADRDs. Increasing lifespan alone, without treating dementia, will only delay disease onset or even prolongdisease duration, and thus worsen the ADRD problem, which is the consequence of ever increasing lifespans.We present a proof of principle GNP, J147 and show that it extends lifespan, prevents memory loss, and evenrestores memory when treatment is initiated in 20-24 month old wild type or symptomatic APPswe mice. Wepropose a testable model in which J147 protects neurons from ongoing proteotoxic stress by lowering ATPsynthase activity, shifting energy metabolism towards glycolysis accompanied by accumulation of acetyl-CoA.Accumulating acetyl-CoA leads to increased H3K9 histone acetylation and protects synapse related geneexpression from transcriptional drift -the age-associated deterioration of transcriptional programs- andconsequently from functional decline. In the following proposal we will test this model in detail by conductingneuropathology, electrophysiology and behavioral assays in aged wild type mice and two mouse models ofADRD. We show that these effects are evolutionarily conserved and that lowering ATP synthase activityextends lifespan in M. musculus, D. melanogaster and C. elegans. As both, ATP synthase and the age-associated transcriptional drift of synaptic genes are evolutionarily conserved from M. musculus to C. eleganswe will use C. elegans to identify the chromatin remodeling factor that controls synapse related geneexpression in aging and how it respond to mitochondrial insults. We will validate the role of the identified factorin controlling chromatin on synaptic promoters in primary neurons, aged wild type mice and mouse models ofADRD. Finally, we will expand our GNP concept to profile geroprotective compounds identified by theintervention testing program (ITP) for their ability to protect neurons from different age-associated toxicities andto identify combinations of geroprotectors that are complementary in their protective effects. Because ADRDsare complex diseases with multiple pathological aspects that are unlikely to be addressable by a single drug,we predict rationally designed combinations of geroprotectors to outperform individual geroprotectors.Together these studies will provide deep insights into how aging and ADRDs compromise synapse functionand how this can be addressed by treatment with single GNPs or rational GNP combinations.--NarrativeAging is the biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). In this applicationwe present data showing ATP synthase to link aging and ADRDs at the molecular level and propose a modelon how it extends lifespan and restores memory in aged symptomatic mouse models of ADRD throughGeroNeuroProtection. We show ATP synthase to be druggable and how the concept of geroneuroprotectioncan be expanded to test other geroproprotector drugs identified by the intervention testing program (ITP) fortheir ability to protect neurons from age-associated toxicities in ADRDs.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryGeroscience refers to the multi-disciplinary approach to understand, at the molecular level, the relationship be-tween aging-associated pathologies and aging. Unfortunately, there continues to be a fundamental knowledgegap in implicating how these mechanisms predispose to a myriad of diseases with advancing age, includingneurodegenerative diseases (ND) like Alzheimer?s disease (AD). This lack of comprehension represents a sig-nificant problem because, until it is recognized, development of interventions that prevent or attenuate this de-bilitating disease will continue to be unattainable. Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate with age and at sites ofage-related pathology and have been demonstrated to actively drive tissue deterioration. As removal of thesecells has largely beneficial consequences for aging and lifespan, these cells are particularly attractive candi-dates to test the geroscience hypothesis that attenuated ?rates of aging? may delay neurodegenerative diseas-es and other age-related conditions. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to exploit SnC clearance as a ther-apeutic strategy for a variety of age-related diseases, including AD. Cells with features reminiscent of senes-cence have been observed in post mortem AD patients, therefore the overall objective in this application is todetermine whether SnC elimination from established ND models attenuates disease severity. The central hy-pothesis is that SnCs actively drive disease processes and that removal of these cells will prevent or delay ADprogression and severity. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of unpublished preliminary dataproduced in the applicants? laboratory included in this application. The rationale for the proposed research isthat once it is known how senescence of specific cell types in the brains impacts pathology, it can be tested ifnovel pharmacological modulations of SnCs and\\/or their effects influences the disease process. Guided bystrong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Establish the therapeu-tic potential of SnC removal in ND; and 2) Evaluate how attenuated SnC accumulation impacts ND and normalcognitive aging. Under the first aim, various methods of SnC elimination will be used in established disease toattenuate severity using novel mouse models established as feasible in the applicants? laboratory. Under thesecond aim, senescence in specific cell types will be prevented to determine how this influences disease se-verity and SnCs will be genetically removed from geriatric mice to determine if this impacts cognition. The ap-proach is innovative, in the applicant?s opinion, because it departs from the status quo by utilizing an entirelynovel approach to counteract ND through modulation of SnCs. The proposed research is significant, because itwill address key fundamental questions about SnCs in ND and test whether targeting SnCs is a potential ther-apeutic strategy for this disease. This knowledge will pave the way towards transformative clinical interventionsfor treating or preventing not only ND, but also a broad spectrum of human age-related diseases.--NarrativeThe proposed research is relevant to public health because defining the contribution of senescent cells to neu-rodegenerative disease using mouse models is ultimately expected to fundamentally increase our understand-ing of the pathogenesis of disease in humans; as well as elucidate how aging contributes to these alterations.Through these efforts; transformative clinical interventions for treating patients plagued by neurodegenerativepathologies like Alzheimer?s disease can be developed. Thus; the proposed research is relevant to the part ofNIH?s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of hu-man disability.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTThis application investigates the relationship between obesity, senescence, brain aging and thedevelopment of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Cellular senescence is a well-established driver oftissue and organismal aging, a process thought to be partly mediated via the induction of achronic Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Consequently, there is greatinterest in selectively targeting senescent cells as a strategy to promote healthy aging. We havefound that senescent markers accumulated in glia cells and neurons in different brain regions ofobese and aged mice. Importantly, we showed that clearance of senescent cells, using bothgenetic and pharmacological approaches, restored neurogenesis and significantly decreasedobesity-induced anxiety-like behavior. Additionally, we found that senescent cells were acontributor to the accumulation of fat deposits in the brain, a phenotype common betweenaging, obesity and AD. This led us to hypothesize that obesity, by inducing senescence in thebrain, exacerbates age-related cognitive decline and contributes to neurodegenerative diseasessuch as AD.In order to test our hypothesis, we will use innovative mouse models which allow the eliminationof either p21Cip1 or p16Ink4a positive senescent cells (p21-ATTAC and INK-ATTAC), as well as anovel transgenic model LOX-ATTAC (which we will cross with different Cre-expressing mice)allowing us to clear p16Ink4a senescent cells specifically in neurons, microglia and astrocytes.Using these models, we will be able to elucidate the functional impact of senescent cellclearance during aging and obesity, in particular, the relative contribution of different cell-types(aim1). Additionally, we will examine the mechanisms mediating impaired lipid metabolismduring senescence in particular the role of lipid import, lipogenesis and ?-oxidation to cellularsenescence by using a combination of genetic and imaging approaches as well as massspectrometry lipidomics studies.

Time is running short if we wish to avert a global public health disaster with untold suffering,disruption of families, and severe challenges to health care systems and economies. Effectual solutions willcome only from innovative research. While aging is the biggest risk factor for developing AD, it is unclear towhat extent normal aging is distinct from AD and which age-related factors drive disease. Senescence is ahomeostatic response, which aims to prevent the propagation of these damaged cells while they remain viableand metabolically active. Senescent-like phenotypes have been described in neurons despite neurons beingpost-mitotic cells and these cells may release factors that trigger senescence in surrounding glia. Senescentglia and senescent-like neurons increase in the brain with age and are thought to contribute to the loss offunction associated with aging and age-related diseases like AD. Our application, entitled ?Uncoupling Age-Versus Cognitive-Related Cellular Senescence in Alzheimer's Disease,? is highly responsive to the objectivesoutlined in the RFA-AG-20-025, by leveraging an innovative molecular imaging platform we invented atStanford; multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), in order to uncouple age- from cognitive decline-related cellularsenescence. MIBI enables us to quantify, with low nanometer resolution, high-dimensional, protein-levelexpression patterns, single-cell (neuro\\/immune) interactions, and spatial localization of senescence- and AD-relevant molecules (Aim 1) in a model of healthy aging (Aim 2) and well-characterized cases of AD relatedcognitive impairment (Aim 3). Importantly, MIBI allows all of this to be accomplished in archival FFPE material,thus allowing retrospective analysis on a variety of existing cohorts. By creating in-depth, phenotypic cellularsignatures with spatial context from our unique aging and cognitive cohorts, we will be able to provide insightfor modifiable factors promoting cognitive decline by filtering those specifically associated with aging alone. Inthis research program, collaborative expertise in clinical neuropathology and cognitive decline, technologicaladvancements in imaging, biochemical\\/molecular and cellular biology, and machine learning analyticsconverge in this proposed research program to address the spatio-cellular (neuro\\/immune, senescent)heterogeneity in non-human primate (NHP) and human models of healthy aging and AD brains. Furthermore,it will be synergistic to, and draw on expertise developed in existing infrastructure to image and organize ADclinical pathology (R01AG056287, R01AG057915, MPIs: SC Bendall, RM Angelo, TJ Montine) as well as theNIA-funded 90+ UCI cohort, control material housed in the Stanford ADRC, and NHP specimens (P50AG047366 co-I: TJ Montine). We will reveal cellular senescent phenotypes that differentiate AD from normalage-associated senescence.--Project NarrativeAlzheimer's disease (AD) is an age- and neurodegenerative related disease estimated to affectfive million or more of the ageing American population by 2050. There is thus an urgent need toidentify unique predictive signatures that correlate with developing AD.

Senescentcells cease proliferation, undergo metabolic and transcriptional changes and secrete various pro-inflammatorymolecules, collectively known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP mediates many ofthe pathophysiological effects of senescence with advancing age in many tissues. Recent data in the brainsuggest that glial cells become senescent during neurodegeneration. This includes microglia, a resident CNSmacrophage. Importantly, ablating all senescent glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyteprogenitor cells, is neuroprotective in mouse models of Alzheimer?s disease (AD)-related and tau-dependentneurodegeneration. However, it is unknown how senescence impacts microglial function and how senescentmicroglia then contribute to the disease process. A common feature among neurodegenerative diseases arereactive, pro-inflammatory microglia with dysfunctional phagocytic function, we will now test the hypothesis thatsenescence inhibits normal microglial phagocytic function and promotes a pro-inflammatory cell type, whichaccelerates AD-relevant neurodegeneration. We will test this hypothesis using a senescence regulator Smurf2as a genetic tool. Using cell culture or mice with conditional overexpression of Smurf2, we have the uniquecapability to induce senescence specifically in microglia with high temporal resolution in vitro and in vivo. Wealso can express a ligase-dead Smurf2 as an elegant control for protein overexpression. Using these tools, wewill investigate whether senescence in microglia affects their ability to phagocyte synapses and amyloid A? inAim 1. In Aim 2, we will assess how senescence affects microglial homeostasis and transition into a reactive,pro-inflammatory state.

Astrocytes are integral components of brain architecture, and critically regulate brain function andplasticity through dynamic interactions with synapses. Accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau proteinin astrocytes is common in aging and is exacerbated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, hyper-phosphorylatedtau in neurons detaches from microtubules to form soluble aggregates, destabilizing the microtubulecytoskeleton. Pathogenic soluble tau aggregates (also called tau oligomers) are then released and transfer trans-neuronally, promoting tau aggregation and destabilization of the microtubule cytoskeleton in target cells.Aging contributes the largest biological risk for AD; yet the mechanisms that link aging to AD remain elusive. Thedevelopment of cellular senescence and the accumulation of senescent cells during aging compromises tissuefunction. Senescent astrocytes accumulate in AD brain. We discovered that, similar to trans-neuronalpropagation, soluble pathogenic tau aggregates are transmitted to astrocytes, where they potently triggermicrotubule destabilization and cellular senescence. The functional impact of tau transmission to astrocytes, andits contribution to AD, however, remain unexplored. Our central hypotheses are that: (a) tau-induced astrocytesenescence is a key driver of neuronal dysfunction and cognitive decline in AD, and (b) removal of pathogenictau or senescent astrocytes will treat AD-related dysfunction in a surrogate model of AD by restoring neuronalfunction. We propose two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will define how tau transmission causes astrocyte senescence,and will identify heterogeneous subtypes of senescent astrocytes and their secreted factors in a surrogatemodel of AD tauopathy; Aim 2 will (a) establish the therapeutic potential of pathogenic tau or senescent cellremoval in AD-related neuronal and cognitive dysfunction, (b) determine, in human brains, how accumulation ofastrocyte tau and of senescent astrocytes is linked to molecular abnormalities identified in Aim 1 during ADprogression; and (c) define the incidence of heterogeneous subtypes of senescent astrocytes identified in Aim 1in human AD. This work will address, for the first time, the involvement of tau-induced astrocyte senescence inAD etiology, and will markedly advance knowledge of how pathogenic tau (and the cellular events it triggers) andsenescence itself can be targeted therapeutically. By singling out astrocyte senescence as a novel mechanismof AD-like pathogenesis in mice, we will open up a completely new avenue of investigation in AD.Because tau immunotherapy is being advanced in the clinic and the senolytics we will use are FDA-approved,our results could have rapid translational potential, contributing new and urgently needed tools to treat AD andpotentially other dementias.--PROJECT NARRATIVEAccumulation of cells undergoing senescence during aging compromises tissue function.

In-vitro experiments of senescence often utilize contrivedstressors such as hydrogen peroxide or radiation, that may not be physiologically relevant for age-relateddiseases such as AD. Furthermore, the senescence phenotypes observed in vitro are likely not complete modelsfor what is occurring in dynamic biological systems. Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Abo), an important hallmark in AD, have been shown to potently inducesenescence in a variety of brain cell types and environments, in contrast to fibrillar Ab. Abo is thought to bindmembrane proteins and subsequently signal downstream aggregation of related amyloids such as tau. In fact,the presence of endogenous Abo is one of the strongest indicators of disease severity in AD models andorganisms, suggesting a link between AD and cellular senescence that is only beginning to be explored. In order to study this association, we propose to combine gold-standard techniques and single-cell omicsdata in order to define heterogenous genetic and epigenetic signatures of senescence that are distinctly afunction of their induction type. Doing so will also produce robust signatures and biomarkers of senescence inbrain cells that can be utilized for the pathological phenotyping of human tissues. These measures will also allowfor the comparison of disparate senescent behaviors to help identify lab-derived amyloids that best resemblepatient-derived constructs. We will evaluate multiple lab-derived Abo constructs, including those stabilized fromlipids located in predominantly diseased regions of the brain. Observations would be synergistically coupled withsolution biophysics experiments and molecular modeling, providing analogous structural data for each inducertype. Taken together, these measurements will uniquely profile senescence in brain cells, define the degree ofoverlap between endogenous senescence inducers and those reconstituted in the lab, and highlighting how ADrisk is modulated by cellular senescence.--PROJECT NARRATIVEOne of the most well-known hallmarks of human aging is cellular senescence; however the relationship betweensenescence and Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) is poorly understood.

In order to test this hypothesis; we will utilize acombination of genetic and epigenetic measurements to compare the ability of synthetic and patient-derivedamyloids to induce senescence in brain cells; thereby deducing the molecular and epigenetic overlap betweensenescence and AD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project DescriptionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder featuring progressive cognitive,functional, and behavioral defects. Currently, more than 5.6 million Americans suffer from AD, and this numberis projected to increase to 15.0 million by 2060. Despite several clinical interventions have been approved fortreatment of AD, unfortunately they have demonstrated only modest effects in modifying the clinical symptomsfor relatively short periods with none showing a clear therapeutic effect on disease progression. The lack of aclear understanding of the mechanisms driving the pathogenesis and progression of AD is a significant barrierto the development of innovative and effective therapies. The goal of this proposal is to address this gap bydefining the role of senescence in brain aging and AD pathogenesis. My lab and those of others have shownthat the number of senescent cells was markedly increased in the brain of AD patients and that the removal ofsenescent cells can prevent cognitive declines and attenuate AD pathology in preclinical animal models. Theseresults suggest a critical role for senescent cells in AD pathogenesis and treatment. Based on evidenceprovided by us and others that 1) oxidative stress is a pathological feature of AD, and 2) increased numbers ofsenescent astrocytes have been identified in the brain of AD patients, we hypothesize that aging-associatedoxidative stress leads to the accumulation of senescent cells in the brain, which in turn promote thepathogenesis and progression of AD via exacerbating amyloid beta (A?)-induced neurotoxicity and taupathology. Therefore, pharmacological elimination of senescent cells can be exploited as a new strategy forAD prevention and treatment.

A major gap in our knowledge is understanding the mechanisms that lead to astrocytesenescence. Our long-term goal is to define the molecular targets and therapeutic interventions that slow agingby inhibiting senescence and to determine their impact on neurodegenerative diseases. The overall objective inthis application is to: 1) define the mechanisms by which the glycolytic by-product methylglyoxal (MGO) drivesastrocyte senescence and 2) enhance the detoxification of MGO to mitigate astrocyte senescence andneurodegeneration in models of AD. Our central hypothesis is that MGO induces senescence in astrocytes,which secrete pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors that cause theneurodegeneration associated with dementia and AD. The rationale of our hypothesis is based partly on thefact that astrocytes are known to be the metabolic workhorses of the brain and undertake glycolysis to provideneurons with lactate. Consequently, astrocytes produce more MGO and show increased activity of the MGOdetoxifying pathways. We observe that MGO, which enhances macromolecular damage, causes senescence.Thus, strategies to detoxify MGO can provide novel approaches to lowering the risk of AD and relatedneurodegeneration in the elderly. We will test the hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1).Determine the mechanisms by which MGO drives senescence in human iPSC derived astrocytes; 2) Determinethe mechanisms by which senescent astrocytes cause neuronal damage; and 3) Determine the role of the Trpa1pathway in modulating MGO-induced senescence and AD pathology in mouse models. We will use iPSCderived astrocytes to determine the mechanisms by which MGO mediates senescence. Furthermore, we willuse proteomics to define the SASP of MGO-induced senescent astrocytes and determine the effect of the SASPon iPSC-derived neurons carrying wild type and mutant alleles of tau using co-cultures. We will genetically andpharmacologically manipulate Trpa1 to detoxify MGO to test its effects on senescence and associatedneurodegeneration in two mouse models of AD. We will combine the treatments to detoxify MGO and eliminatesenescent cells to determine if they are working through the same pathways to inhibit neurodegeneration. Theproposed research is innovative because it will determine a novel function for MGO, an endogenous metaboliteproduced during glycolysis, in driving astrocytic senescence and, thus, neurodegeneration. Akey significance of this work will help us understand the link between metabolism, inflammation, andneurodegeneration. It will also pave the way to developing novel therapies for treating Alzheimer?s and relateddementias based on reducing the presence or activity of senescent cells and by lowering MGO.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on developing a new and alternativestrategy to treat Alzheimer?s disease (AD) by eliminating senescent astrocytes that contribute to inflammationand neurodegeneration. We will achieve this by determining the role of the glycolytic by-product methylglyoxalin driving astrocyte senescence and neurodegeneration in AD. These studies will develop novel therapeutictargets to inhibit cellular senescence in the brain and reduce the risk of AD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY Aberrant glial activation has been postulated to promote neurodegeneration. But, what triggers glial activationand how perturbations to glia-neuron interaction contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration remainsunclear. The scientific premise of this proposal is based on previously published work that dominant mutation inhuman Progranulin (GRN) gene is a major cause for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in GRN cause adrastic reduction in Progranulin (PGRN) protein levels in brain tissues and eventually lead to neuropathologycharacterized by profound gliosis, severe neuron loss, and aggregation of RNA binding protein TDP-43 inremaining neurons (also known as ?TDP-43 proteinopathy?). In addition to its role in FTD, single nucleotidepolymorphism (SNP) in the GRN gene has been associated with increased risk of TDP-43 proteinopathy inAlzheimer's disease (AD) and in the aging brain. Together, these results support the idea that PGRN deficiencymay have broader impacts on neurodegeneration. To investigate the role of PGRN deficiency inneurodegeneration, we have shown that mouse models of PGRN deficiency recapitulate several keyneuropathological features in FTD caused by GRN mutations, including microglial activation, microglia-mediatedsynaptic pruning, and dysfunction in the thalamocortical circuit, which contribute to obsessive-compulsivedisorder (OCD)-like behaviors in these mice. In addition, we used single cell transcriptomic analyses to showthat Grn-\\/- microglia exhibit early onset and persistent transcriptomic changes in genes involved in theendolysosomal pathway and innate immunity functions. Furthermore, proteomic and morphological analyses inGrn-\\/- microglia revealed prominent features of cellular senescence, including increased phagocytosis, lysosomaldysfunction, proliferative arrest, and increased secretion of complements C1q and C3b. These results supportthe hypothesis that PGRN deficiency disrupts endolysosomal function and activates the cellular senescenceprogram in microglia leading to persistent microglial activation to promote synaptic pruning and neuronal celldeath. To test this hypothesis, we will (1) determine the role of integrin ?v?3 and TGF-? pathway in promotingcellular senescence in Grn-\\/- microglia, (2) characterize the secretory phenotype in senescent microglia in Grn-\\/-mice and its impact on neurodegeneration, and (3) elucidate the impact of PGRN deficiency on microglialsenescence and neurodegeneration in FTD and Alzheimer's disease. Results from this proposal will providecritical insights into the mechanism of PGRN deficiency in microglial senescence and its role inneurodegeneration in FTD and AD.--PROJECT NARRATIVEMutations in the Progranulin (GRN) gene have been causally linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GRN has been implicated as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease(AD). To provide mechanistic insights for cellular senescence in Grn-\\/- microglia and determine how Grn-\\/-microglia contribute to neurodegeneration; we have developed innovative strategies that use single celltranscriptomics and quantitative proteomics to provide molecular and physiological properties that promote glialactivation and neuronal degeneration caused by Progranulin deficiency. Our results will provide unprecedentedclarity on disease mechanism in FTLD and AD.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryThe neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional structure that consists of endothelial cells, surrounded by anextracellular matrix, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. The NVU enables regulation of regional cerebral bloodflow and nutrient delivery to the brain tissue. With aging, a structural weakening of the NVU occurs, which is alsoassociated with inflammatory signaling and transport deficiencies. Critically, it is not clear how neurons,astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells undergo senescence in the NVU, and whether there are differencesin senescence pathways between healthy NVU aging and NVU in Alzheimer's diseases (AD).The G-quadruplex (G4) is a non-canonical DNA secondary structure formed by four DNA strands containingmultiple runs of guanines. G4s play important roles in DNA recombination, replication, and regulation oftranscription. In our data, we demonstrated that brain samples from aged mice contain more G4s than that ofyoung mice. We showed that mice treated with a small-molecule G4 stabilizer develop cognitive impairment andaccelerated brain aging. Using a heterochronic parabiosis mouse model, we also showed that the levels of G4sare decreased in the brain of old parabiont, compared to the age-matched iso-parabiotic mice, implicatingpresence of rejuvenating factors that can reverse the elevation of G4s with aging. The effect of the old parabionton the young partner is more pronounced (more G4s in the young), suggesting a strong negative influence ofaging factors. Importantly, in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that G4s are stabilized in the brains, wellbefore the deposition of amyloid occurs. We hypothesize that these converging lines of evidence point at ?mechanism of senescence. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed studies is to investigate G4-associatedcellular senescence in the NVU, in aging and AD. In Aim 1, we will compare G4s across cell types in the NVU.In Aim 2, we will determine whether G4s preferentially accumulate in the NVUs of brain regions most vulnerableto neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will investigate how a peripheral factor, CXCL10, contributes to NVU's G4senescence. G4s might be a novel pathway that can be targeted to mitigate the detrimental effects of cellularsenescence in the brain.--Project NarrativeSenescent cells accumulate in aging and drive deficits accompanying age-associated diseases. This projectinvestigates the role of a novel nuclear pathway; the G-quadruplex (G4) DNA pathway; in senescence ofneurovascular unit (NVU) in the brain. The formation of G4 DNA is associated with chromatin remodeling;transcriptional changes; and DNA damage; we hypothesize that stabilization of G4s leads to senescence of thecomponents of the NVU - endothelial cells; astrocytes; neurons; and pericytes.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/AbstractAdvanced chronological age is the greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer?s disease. Accumulatingevidence suggests that disease processes may begin decades prior to dementia. Therefore, cellular andmolecular processes that contribute to biological aging may also modulate Alzheimer?s disease pathogenesis.We recently identified a fundamental cellular aging stress response, cellular senescence, as a pathogenicprocess driving neurodegeneration in tauopathies, brain diseases histologically defined by tau proteinaccumulation. Features of cellular senescence include stable cell cycle arrest and toxic secretory phenotype.In this way, senescent cells escape cell death and become persistently deleterious to their surroundingenvironment. We have found a causal relationship connecting tau accumulation (i.e. neurofibrillary tangles),a neuronal senescence-like phenotype, and chronic neurodegeneration in tauopathies, including Alzheimer?sdisease. As terminally differentiated cells, neurons may seem incapable of initiating a senescence stressresponse. However, our data indicate that neurons with mature neurofibrillary tangles are arrested in acellular senescence-like state. The objective of this project is to identify the upstream molecular mediatorsand downstream cellular consequences of neuronal senescence in the human brain. High resolution profilingmethods will be applied to analyze neurons across the adult human lifespan, and throughout the progressivestages of Alzheimer?s disease. This project will significantly advance the basic understanding of this novelneuronal cell fate, cellular senescence, and its influence on brain health. Moreover, the cellular and molecularpathways identified in our project may reveal novel therapeutic targets for intervention, and the age\\/stage ofdisease where they would be most beneficial.--Project Narrative (3 sentences).Advanced chronological age is the greatest risk factor for developing Alzheimer?s disease; the most commoncause of dementia and the only top ten cause of death in America without an effective treatment. Thisresearch proposal will closely investigate an aging process that recently has been recognized for its role inAlzheimer?s disease; called cellular senescence. The results will reveal how cellular senescence changes inthe brain throughout the adult human lifespan in health and during progressive stages of Alzheimer?s disease;which may unveil new targets for developing disease-modifying therapies.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ ABSTRACT More than 50 million people over the age of 65 are currently affected by vascularcognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Although the specific mechanisms for aging-induced VCID are not yet known, there is increasing evidence that alterations of theneurovascular unit play a crucial role. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate themechanistic role of senescence-related endothelial dysfunction in cognitive impairment. Thecentral hypothesis is that aging primarily promotes endothelial senescence in the brain andsubsequent dysfunction, altering the production of vasodilator mediators, impairingneurovascular coupling responses, promoting blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption andmicrovascular rarefaction. The resulting decline in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and increasedneuroinflammation contribute to cognitive impairment. The proposed work is novel as it will bethe first to demonstrate that aging-induced endothelial senescence is a critical contributingfactor to the pathogenesis of VCID. The results will likely identify specific mechanisms andreveal potential therapies that are capable of improving CBF and restoring learning andmemory. The following aims are proposed: 1) Determine how endothelial senescence altersneurovascular coupling responses, CBF and cognition in aging. The working hypothesis is thataging-induced activation of p16-dependent cellular senescence program in endothelial cellsimpairs vasodilator function. It is predicted that elimination of senescent endothelialcells, through genetic manipulation or through senolytic therapies will restore neurovascularfunction and improve CBF and cognition in aged mice. 2) Determine how senescence altersmicrovascular density and BBB integrity in aging. The working hypothesis is that activation ofp16-dependent cellular senescence program in endothelial cells impairs endothelial barrierfunction and compromise the maintenance of the microcirculatory network. It is predicted thatelimination of senescent cells will restore BBB, attenuating neuroinflammation and increasecerebromicrovascular density in aged mice. 3) Determine cellular heterogeneity amongsenescent endothelial cells in conjunction with their morphological and functionalcharacteristics. Together, the proposed studies will identify a fundamental mechanismgoverning aging-induced cerebrovascular changes eventually leading to cognitive impairment.--NARRATIVEThe human brain is supplied by 600 km of vessels where each neuron has its supplyingmicrovessel. Aging impairs functionally and structurally the cerebromicrovasculature andthus induces consequential neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Endothelialsenescence; as a damage response in aging; might contribute to impaired cerebralmicrovascular function and structure and by selective elimination of senescent cells offersnew targets for prevention and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY \\/ ABSTRACTSenescent cells develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) involving pro-inflammatory andpro-oxidative factors that can elicit deleterious paracrine-like effects on neighboring cells. Independently of theoriginal stressor, senescence can also spread from senescent to non-senescent bystander cells in a processknown as senescence-induced senescence (SIS). Neurons were historically considered to be unable to undergocellular senescence. Recent research has however provided evidence that neurons may be able to undergosenescence during normal aging and disease. Senolytic drugs, which selectively kill senescent cells, have forexample been shown to improve functions in the brains of animal models of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and relateddementias. This new approach is of great importance?clinical trials investing efficacy of amyloid beta (A?)antibodies have led to disappointing failures and no known disease-modifying treatments have to date beenidentified. There is however a caveat to the use of senolytics for AD and related disorders. It is not known whethersenolytics kill senescent glial cells and spare neurons because they cannot senesce, or if senolytics not only killsenescent glial cells but also senescent neurons. Senescent cells in the periphery are normally removed byimmune cells including natural killer (NK) cells. Due to its unique immune privilege, senescent cells in the brainmay initially be able to evade removal by NK cells, allowing for an increase and spread in the overall senescentcell load. When immune privilege becomes compromised in later stages of the disease, this could result in alarge-scale removal of senescent cells including neurons. It is unclear whether this would be beneficial ordetrimental to global brain health. We will initially assess neuronal senescence in mixed primary humanneuronal-astrocytic 2D and 3D cultures recently generated by our laboratory in response to Abeta-mediatedstress. We will then determine the role of senescence in vivo utilizing a well-characterized AD mouse model, the3xTg AD line. This line has been crossed with a p16-3MR transgenic mouse model that allows the identificationand inducible ablation of senescent cells. Use of these models will allow us to determine: (1) the ability ofneurons, astrocytes, and other CNS cell types to undergo stress-mediated senescence and a SASP, (2) whetherthis is accompanied by an Abeta-independent SIS, (3) whether late-stage losses in immune privilege enablesclearance of senescent cells via infiltration of peripheral immune cells, and (4) whether senescent cell removalis beneficial or detrimental and at what stage of disease progression.--PROJECT NARRATIVESenescent cells develop an inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and can alsospread from senescent to non-senescent bystander cells in a process known as senescence-inducedsenescence (SIS).

Using both in vitro human 2D and 3D cell cultures and a newly generated mouse AD model in whichsenescent cells can be tracked and inducibly eliminated we will determine: (1) the ability of neurons to undergostress-mediated senescence and a SASP; (2) whether this is accompanied by an Abeta-independent SIS; (3)whether late-stage losses in immune privilege enables clearance of senescent cells via infiltration of peripheralimmune cells; and (4) whether senescent cell removal is beneficial or detrimental and at what stage of diseaseprogression.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/Abstract The largest risk factor for developing chronic disease, including neurodegenerative diseases, such asAlzheimer?s disease (AD), is age. There is now abundant evidence that aging processes can be driven by DNAdamage, which is ubiquitous and a cause of many adverse cell fates, such as apoptosis and cellular senescence.A major pathologic consequence of DNA damage and its erroneous repair is DNA mutation, from basesubstitutions to very large chromosomal alterations. With the emergence of advanced single-cell technology ithas recently been shown that mutations accumulate in neurons during human aging at a frequency that is higherin brains affected by neurodegeneration. This is in keeping with earlier findings using cytogenetic methodsindicating increased aneuploidy associated with Alzheimer?s disease. We have recently shown that increasedaneuploidy induces cellular senescence, including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).Clearance of senescent cells has shown beneficial effects on various aspects of AD disease progressionimplicating cellular senescence as an emerging and important cell fate in the biology of age-relatedneurodegeneration. Recent work suggests that cellular processes involving non-neuronal cells (NeuN-negativecells) significantly contribute to the pathology of AD in both humans and mouse models. Studying normativeaging in the mouse we identified a significant accumulation of aneuploidy in NeuN-negative cells isolated fromthe cerebral cortex, but not from the cerebellum of old mice. In this application we propose to build on our observations to test the hypothesis that NeuN-negativecells in the brain are particularly susceptible to age related accumulation of aneuploidy and large-scale genomicinstability promoting senescence. Genomic instability-induced senescent NeuN-negative cells could fail toaccomplish their neuronal nursing functions and\\/or acquire neurotoxic properties and be particularly detrimentalfor AD progression. To test our hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will establish the genomic landscape of cells from thehuman cortex and hippocampus during normal aging and AD. Using newly developed, highly sensitive singlecell-based assays including multiple displacement amplification (SCMDA) and multicolor interphase DNA-RNA-FISH (iDR-FISH) to measure aneuploidy and senescence in situ we will compare NeuN-negative and NeuN-positive cells from healthy aged donors to age-matched AD patients and young adult controls. This will establisha comprehensive analysis of aneuploidy and\\/or other forms of genomic instability during human aging in brainregions and cell types associated with AD and AD-type dementias. In Aim 2 using primary cells as well asinduced human pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from late-onset AD patients and disease-free controls, we willstudy the cell non-autonomous effects of aneuploidy-induced senescence on neurons using co-culture models.Two small molecules that promote the death of aneuploid cells, alone or together, will be tested for the potentialto kill aneuploidy-induced senescent astrocytes and ameliorate their potential detrimental effects on neurons. Globally, these studies will provide detailed new knowledge of large-scale genomic instability in aged andAD brain and its functional link to senescent cells as a possible causal factor in AD. This will open up newpossibilities for novel interventions, e.g., using the new generation of geroscience interventions.--!NarrativeThe largest risk factor for developing a host of pathologies; most prominently Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and otherage-related dementias; is age.

While presently there is no cure for Alzheimer?s disease, existing literature indicates that earlydiagnosis in the preclinical stage, i.e., before the onset of clinical symptoms, will be key to treatments. There isa pressing need for noninvasive predictors of cognitive decline that can enable early identification of individualsat Alzheimer?s disease risk. A mounting body of scientific evidence suggests that sleep disturbances (includingmicroarchitectural disruptions to non-rapid-eye-motion sleep and decline in sleep quality) might be the earliestobservable symptoms of Alzheimer?s disease. On-the-go sleep and activity monitoring could address the needfor noninvasive indicators of cognitive decline in subjects who are in the (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic)preclinical stage of Alzheimer?s disease. Here, we will build on preliminary results that reveal a set of sleepfeatures derived from polysomnography (PSG) that are predictive of cognitive performance. We are proposingto perform secondary analysis of sleep and cognition data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)cohort using state-of-the-art deep learning tools to enable sleep-based prediction of cognitive impairment forearly detection of Alzheimer?s disease. While PSG is the gold standard for sleep measurement, it is not well-suited for routine, day-to-day use. In comparison, wrist-based measurements (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate, ECG,and pulse oximetry) obtained from wearable devices allow ?on-the-go? sleep monitoring. The combination ofthese on-the-go measures with the latest artificial intelligence tools is a feasible route to early Alzheimer?sdiagnostics. We will use attention-guided long short-term memory autoencoders to identify overt and latentcharacteristics of the raw time-series datasets, which will allow us to more effectively mine the rich MESA dataresource. Our deep learning framework will also take into account sociodemographic variables, indicators ofhealth status, and medications. To ensure scientific rigor, secondary validation of the MESA-trained deeplearning models will be performed on PSG and actigraphy data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, which is alongitudinal study designed to further our understanding of what differentiates normal aging from preclinicalAlzheimer?s disease. To address any concern about the ?black-box? nature of deep learning models, we willcompare the learned feature set with sleep microarchitectural features previously computed using classicalstatistical techniques. Previous data suggests that a subject?s apolipoprotein ?4 (ApoE4) allele carrier statusinfluences the degree to which their sleep patterns impact their cognitive abilities. We will verify this byincorporating ApoE4 status as an additional input to the deep learning model. Literature shows that over 60% ofpatients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer?s disease have at least one clinical sleep disorder. Theon-the-go prediction paradigm using noninvasive sleep measurements to be validated in this project will have asignificant impact on early Alzheimer?s diagnostics and facilitate ongoing clinical trials.--PROJECT NARRATIVESleep disturbances are a common feature of dementia due to Alzheimer?s disease.

AD is a leading cause ofadult disability and the most common cause of dementia in the United States. Despite thetremendous worldwide investment in addressing AD, therapeutic approaches shown to haveefficacy in mouse models have failed in human clinical trials with late-onset sporadic AD. Theoverall objective of this application is to study the time course of cerebral blood flow (CBF) andcerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) in development of late-onset sporadic ADpathology. We will address key issues such as age-related changes in cerebral microvascularstructure (using optical clearing) and function (using optical measurements of CBF and CMRO2)applied to two AD mouse models: the well-established 3xTg model pioneered by co-I LaFerla,and the novel LaFerla hA?-KI model of LOAD pathogenesis.

Completion of these studies is expected to contribute toour knowledge on the relationship between neurovascular and metabolic alterations and ADpathogenesis. This innovative approach is expected to pave the way to enhancedunderstanding of age-related AD pathogenesis, and ultimately to informed development of newtherapeutic strategies that target preservation of neurovascular health.

SIVD is clinically defined as cognitivedecline with evidence of subcortical brain infarction. Patients with SIVD suffer from a vast amount of whitematter degeneration due to prolonged cerebral hypoperfusion caused by fibrohyalinosis of the medullaryartery, and often live with poor neurological function. Although the number of patients with SIVD is predictedto increase with the aging population, to date there is no established treatment for this pathologicalcondition.Since white matter dysfunction is a major characteristic of this disease, most of the mechanistic research inSIVD has focused on oligodendrocyte\\/myelin damage and blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage within whitematter. Although the potential for white matter regeneration and recovery has not been widely studied,compensatory responses for axonal regeneration along with oligodendrogenesis were observed in pre-clinical animal models for SIVD. Therefore, it may be beneficial to recruit vascular remodeling as anapproach to support white matter repair\\/remodeling, which may alleviate the cognitive decline of SIVDpatients. Clinical studies indicate that restoring blood flow may improve cognitive function; however,investigations into mechanisms of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in SIVD are still lacking. This isthe major gap in knowledge that we seek to fill.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is heavily involved in regulating angiogenesis and vascular(re)formation under both physiological and pathological conditions. However, its role in SIVD is unclear,especially in the aged brain. Therefore, this exploratory study aims to reveal the roles of VEGF signaling inangiogenic responses in cerebral white matter, by testing three hypotheses in a mouse model of SIVD: (i)compensatory angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in SIVD mice is dampened by age, (ii) aged brainshave a lowered capacity for angiogenesis due to a decrease in VEGF signaling, and (iii) upregulating VEGFsignaling may support vascular repair\\/remodeling in aged SIVD mice.For testing these hypotheses, we propose 2 integrated aims. Aim 1 will show that aged brain has a loweredcapacity for compensatory angiogenesis after cerebral hypoperfusion in mice, and Aim 2 will show thatupregulation of VEGF signaling rescues compensatory angiogenesis in aged hypoperfused-SIVD mice. Thisexploratory study will provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which age-related decline in vascularrepair worsens white matter pathology in SIVD, and will provide a proof-of-concept that VEGF signaling is aviable therapeutic target for SIVD.--PROJECT NARRATIVESubcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) is the most common form of vascular cognitive impairment anddementia syndrome.

Aside from the established vulnerability, the molecular mechanismsunderlying the increased risk of Alzheimer?s disease in women are largely unknown. Alzheimer?s has along prodromal phase which coincides with the menopause transition in women (peri-menopause, age~45-54 years). Peri-menopausal women show higher levels of Alzheimer?s disease brain pathology[amyloid b (Ab) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic loss, and chronic inflammation] compared topre-menopausal women and men. This suggests that mechanisms unique to peri-menopause increasethe susceptibility to Alzheimer?s disease leading to earlier onset and faster progression of the disease.The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the effects of peri-menopause on Alzheimer?s disease pathologyand cognitive decline, as well as to identify molecular pathways differentially expressed in peri-menopausal females compared to young females, males, and ovariectomized females (as a mean ofcomparison to previous published studies). We hypothesize that irregular estrogen cyclicity and estrogen-estrogen receptor interactions during peri-menopause, rather than only loss of estrogen during post-menopause, increase the susceptibility to Alzheimer?s by magnifying the pathology in vulnerable brainregions leading to faster development of cognitive deficits. We will use a novel mouse model ofaccelerated ovarian failure (AOF) which uniquely recapitulates human menopause including peri- andpost-menopause (peri- and post-AOF respectively). Two specific aims will test this hypothesis in thehAPP-J20 (J20) mouse model of Alzheimer?s. Aim 1 will test the sub-hypothesis that irregular estrogenfluctuations at peri-AOF will accelerate cognitive deficits, synaptic loss, and recruitment of microglia andastrocytes in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of J20 mice compared to control mice. Aim 2 willtest the sub-hypothesis that peri-AOF disrupts neuronal pathways involved in Ab metabolism resulting inincreased deposition of Ab plaques in the hippocampus and PFC of our AD females compared to age-matched controls. We will use a unique combination of sophisticated imaging and genomic analysisincluding iDisco, which will allow the 3D quantification of whole brain Ab and glia activation, andtranslational ribosomal profiling (TRAP) for sequencing the pool of actively transcribed mRNA in neurons.Our research outcomes will provide novel insights into the influence of peri-menopause on molecularmechanisms central to Alzheimer?s disease pathogenesis. Our findings will address NIA strategic goals:understand the progression of Alzheimer?s (A), and identify potential therapeutic targets for thedevelopment of precision medicine treatments for men and women (D).--PROJECT NARRATIVE and PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCEIn women; the transitional phase preceding and extending through menopause (peri-menopause; ~45-54 years of age) has been associated with the emergence of earlyAlzheimer?s disease pathological phenotype in known vulnerable brain regions; however;the mechanisms underlying the effect of altered estrogen signaling in these key brainregions is not well understood. We propose the use of a novel mouse model oftransitional menopause to identify the biological mechanisms underlying the effect ofperi-menopause on pathology and symptoms of Alzheimer?s disease. If successful; thisresearch will identify a time-window and therapeutic targets for the development of sex-specific treatments to prevent or delay Alzheimer?s disease in men and women.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY. Disordered sleep is pervasive in the United States and has been declared a publichealth epidemic by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Poor sleep has far-reaching impactson cognition, health, and contributes to an increased risk of many diseases, including Alzheimer?s disease (AD).Electroencephalography (EEG) neural signatures measured during sleep may be sensitive to AD neuropathologythat is predictive of cognitive decline in cognitively normal people years before AD diagnosis. Currently, ADpathology can only be measured in vivo using PET imaging or via spinal taps, which are invasive and expensive.If certain sleep EEG signatures are deemed to be sensitive and specific to AD pathology, they may serve as early,non-invasive, diagnostic biomarkers of the disease. Sleep EEG signals are traditionally measured using bulky,rigid, uncomfortable equipment in an unfamiliar lab setting that can negatively impact sleep signals. Due to theselimitations, sleep EEG data acquisition is typically limited to a single night. As night-to-night sleep variability ispredictive of poor cognitive performance and health outcomes, it is essential to sample multiple nights of sleep.Existing mobile systems are still bulky and lack electrodes needed to reliably assess sleep stages. The multi-PIinterdisciplinary team with complementary expertise in cognitive neuroscience of aging, mechanical\\/biomedicalengineering, and sleep neuroscience will develop and validate a low-cost, virtually imperceptible, soft, wearable,wireless mobile device designed for long-term use and use it to measure individuals? sleep EEG as they sleep intheir own homes over multiple nights. This device is the first example of a fully portable, compact, flexible skin-like hybrid electronics (SKINTRONICS) EEG system that includes ultrathin aerosol-jet printed forehead, eye andchin movement electrodes, a Li-polymer battery, and a micro secure digital (SD) card for data storage. Theelastomer that encapsulates the device protects from interference and ensures high SNR without the need forelectrode gel. All necessary components for EEG recording are contained within a non-sticky adhesive roughlythe size of a Band-Aid\\u00c2\\u00ae that participants can easily apply and remove themselves. This system will be assessedin the lab and at home in young and older adults to ensure feasibility in adults with potentially different levels ofEEG SNR, sleep quality, and comfort with wearable technology. The relationship between individual levels ofsleep EEG metrics and performance on an episodic memory task designed to be highly sensitive to sleep qualityand AD will be assessed for the purposes of confirming that our system reveals sleep EEG-memory associationsconsistent with those in the literature. Ten nights of data will be acquired to test SKINTRONICS long-termcapabilities and in order to separate the predictive value of habitual from night-to-night variability in sleep EEGsignals on memory performance. Results produced by this application will additionally be applicable forlongitudinal studies in participants at risk for AD to determine whether particular sleep EEG patterns, acquiredwith SKINTRONICS, can help identify individuals most likely to exhibit cognitive decline.--PROJECT NARRATIVEPoor sleep has far-reaching short- and long-term impacts on cognition and health; even in the absence of asleep disorder; and certain sleep disruptions may also be predictive of Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Certain neuralsignatures measured during sleep are deemed to be sensitive and specific to AD pathology; they may serve asearly; non-invasive; diagnostic biomarkers of the disease and aid in early detection and treatment. Bydeveloping a low-cost; virtually imperceptible; soft; wearable; wireless mobile device that can reliably measurean individual?s sleep-related brain activity from the comfort of home; we will overcome existing limitations oflab-based and mobile sleep electroencephalography (EEG) systems in human sleep research for both cognitiveand clinical applications.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryA significant fraction of the US population suffers from various degrees of insomnia, conditions particularlyprevalent in the elderly. Fractured sleep has adverse effects on cognitive function and memory, and maycontribute to age-related cognitive decline. The brain is a highly metabolic organ, but during slow-wavesleep, cerebral glucose and oxygen metabolism decline. This reduction in brain metabolism may be criticalfor long-term homeostasis, while an inability to adequately lower brain energy expenditure during sleep maylead to oxidative injury. Prior work examining alterations in brain metabolism during slow-wave sleep reliedon invasive methods. We have, in preliminary work, developed a noninvasive MRI-based method, termedOxFlow, to noninvasively quantify the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2) at a tem-poral resolution of seconds, along with concurrent, in-scanner EEG monitoring. OxFlow quantifies CMRO2via Fick's principle using concurrent measurement of venous O2 saturation and total brain cerebral bloodflow (tCBF). The approach's feasibility has been demonstrated in test subjects in whom neurometabolic pa-rameters were measured during wakefulness and sleep. In Aim 1 of this project we propose to further de-velop the OxFlow method for use in sleep research. Specifically, we will modify the gradient structure to at-tenuate acoustic noise so as to facilitate subjects' ability to initiate and maintain sleep. We will also optimizeEEG filtering procedures to minimize interference of MRI gradient-induced electronic noise to reliably allowsimultaneous EEG recordings needed as a means to establish the subject's stage of consciousness. In Aim2 we will test the hypothesis that in older subjects, slow-wave sleep is associated with a reduced awake-to-sleep decrement in CMRO2 as compared to younger subjects. We will address this hypothesis by subjecting12 young and 12 older subjects (25-40 vs. 60-80 years) to a combined MRI\\/EEG sleep protocol. This studywill provide new noninvasive methods for measuring sleep dependent brain energy regulation and begin todemonstrate its utility in research on brain aging and dementia.--NarrativeSleep is critical for brain health but poor sleep quality; prevalent in older people; impairs memory and othercognitive functions. This project will develop a noninvasive MRI-based method to detect sleep dependentand age related changes in brain energy regulation that may lead to brain injury.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYIn women, aging is characterized by a marked decrease in circulating estrogen (E) levels, which negativelyimpacts many physiological systems including sleep-wake cycles and cognitive performance. Consequently,many postmenopausal women chose to undergo E hormone replacement therapy (HRT), with the hope ofreversing or alleviating these negative symptoms. Unfortunately, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanismsassociated with HRT are poorly understood and the long-term efficacy of these hormonal manipulations on thecentral nervous system are unclear, especially in women who are overweight. Using the rhesus macaque as atranslational animal model, we previously demonstrated an age-associated increase in perturbed sleep-wakecycles, and found that individuals with the most perturbed cycles showed inferior cognitive performance in aspatial memory task, as well as compromised immune responses. We also demonstrated cognitive benefitsresulting from long-term administration of E to old ovariectomized females; importantly, however, the beneficialeffects of E on various physiological functions were not sustained in animals maintained on a high-fat, high-sugar Western-style diet (WSD). The goal of this R21 exploratory study is to test the hypothesis that age-related molecular changes within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) contribute to disrupted sleep-wake cyclesand that these are exacerbated by the marked postmenopausal attenuation of circulating E concentrations,especially when concomitantly exposed to a WSD. Therefore, our study will examine DNA methylationdevelopments within the SCN (Aim 1), and use RNA-seq to profile gene expression changes (Aim 2), usingarchived brain tissue from the following pair-groups of previously-characterized rhesus macaques: 1. Young adult ovary-intact females (on a standard diet) 2. Old ovary-intact females (on a standard diet) 3. Old ovariectomized females (on a standard diet) 4. Old ovariectomized females (on a standard diet + treated with HRT for ~3 years) 5. Old ovariectomized females (on a WSD for ~3 years) 6. Old ovariectomized females (on a WSD for ~3 years + treated with HRT for ~3 years)Using a previously-validated MethylSeq approach to provide single-base resolution DNA methylation data, wewill examine differential methylation CpG (DMC) and region (DMR) in the SCN ? i.e., the well-established siteof the master circadian clock that plays a key role in sleep maintenance and synchronizing daily physiologicalfunctions. We predict that aging, maintenance on a WSD, and insufficient E in the circulation producefunctional epigenetic modifications within the core clock mechanism of the SCN that result in perturbedcircadian activity-rest pattern, and in turn predispose individuals to development of Alzheimer?s disease.--PROJECT NARRATIVELike women; adult female rhesus macaques show ~28-day menstrual cycles and eventually go throughmenopause. The accompanying precipitous decrease in circulating estrogen concentrations is thought tocontribute to several age-associated changes; including sleep perturbation and cognitive decline; yet theunderlying mechanism is poorly understood. In the proposed exploratory\\/developmental study we will test thehypothesis that aging; hormonal status and diet all interact to cause epigenetic modifications within thehypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus; which perturb activity\\/sleep cycles and ultimately predisposeindividuals to development of Alzheimer?s disease pathology.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryMuch of our understanding of brain microcirculation comes from studies on arteriolar perfusion. Blood effluxthrough venules plays an equally important role in determining blood flow through the brain, since all bloodentering the brain must exit via venules. The structure and function of cerebral venules can changedramatically during cerebrovascular disease. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated markedalterations in venule tortuosity and vascular wall composition during Alzheimer?s disease and Alzheimer?sdisease-related dementias. Compared to arterioles, the slower flow and distinct endothelial biology of venulesmakes them more susceptible to hemostasis, thrombosis, and immune cell adhesion during disease.Collectively, these factors point to venules as a site of vulnerability in cerebral perfusion that remains highlyunderstudied. This project focuses on principal cortical venules (PCVs), a subset of venules that descend fromthe brain surface into the deepest layers of cortex and underlying white matter. Although PCVs are lesscommon compared to smaller cortical venules, they extend massive, horizontally projecting branches in deepertissues, suggesting a critical role in perfusion of deep cortex and adjacent white matter tracts. However, thereexists almost no information on the structure, physiology and perfusion territories of PCVs. Cerebral whitematter is particularly sensitive to blood flow deficit and degenerates in early stages of Alzheimer?s disease andAlzheimer?s disease-related dementias. Understanding the regulation of perfusion in and near white mattertracts will be critical in understanding the basis of this white matter degeneration. Our central hypothesis isthat PCVs are the main drainage system for deep cortical layers and the underlying white matter. In Aim 1, wewill test this hypothesis by using emergent deep in vivo two-photon imaging and three-photon imaging tomeasure how capillary flow is drained in cortical layer 6 and its adjacent white matter tract in the mouse brain,respectively. These activities will be performed in adult (3-9 months) and aged mice (18-24 months) to test asecondary hypothesis that age is associated with deterioration in PCV structure and function. In Aim 2, we willwe will quantify the radius of cortical tissue dependent upon PCV drainage by measuring how photothromboticocclusion of a single PCV affects flow into the cortex through neighboring penetrating arterioles. We will furtheruse histology to assess the volume of hypoxic tissue in gray and white matter created by occlusion of singlePCVs. This project is significant because it addresses the understudied topic of venular perfusion in whitematter using novel in vivo imaging approaches. It further establishes an experimental foundation needed forfuture research on venular dysfunction as a mechanism of impaired cerebral blood flow and white matterdegeneration in Alzheimer?s disease and Alzheimer?s disease-related dementias.--Project NarrativeThe degeneration of cerebral white matter is a hallmark of Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias. Thispreclinical project will use cutting-edge microscopy in live mice to study how venules support the drainage ofblood from cerebral white matter and neighboring gray matter. This work is expected to yield insight into age-related changes in perfusion of white matter; and build a novel experimental foundation for visualizing;measuring; and treating venular pathology in mouse models of dementia.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in Americanmen. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a widely applied strategy that can efficiently improve life span andquality of life for prostate cancer patients. However, recent large-scale epidemiologic studies revealed thatpatients with ADT have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to the generalpopulation, raising a severe public health concern. Age-related androgen depletion has been implicated in thepathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. However, the role of ADT for prostate cancer in ADonset and progression has not been clearly defined. Currently, there is no clinically-relevant animal model todirectly examine the effect of ADT on AD development while treating prostate cancer. The primary objective ofthis project is to apply powerful mouse genetic approaches to establish a clinically-relevant tumor-bearing ADmodel and examine how ADT affects AD onset and progression. We have been studying a geneticallyengineered prostate cancer mouse model in which Pten is specifically deleted in prostate using PB-Cre [PB-Cre;Ptenloxp\\/loxp, Pten prostate conditional knockout (cKO) mice, referred to as PtencKO]. We found that the PtencKOline recapitulates prostate cancer features and responses to ADT treatment in human patients. By crossbreedingthis line with a well-established AD model, we expect to create an ideal model to study the interaction betweenADT and AD in the prostate cancer population. We will test the effect of ADT on AD-related cognitiveabnormalities in Aim 1, amyloid-related neuropathological changes in Aim 2, and inflammation\\/immuneresponses in Aim 3. Successfully accomplishing the proposed study will create a unique mouse model that notonly allows us to examine the complex interaction among ADT, AD and prostate cancer, but also may serve asan invaluable tool for evaluating potential clinical therapies aimed at reducing the negative effects of ADT.--In this study; we will test the feasibility of using mouse models to examine the interaction among prostatecancer; Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our study will help us understandthe impact of ADT on AD development and progression in prostate cancer patients.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/AbstractThe etiology of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is elusive. Chronic systemic inflammation has been implicated in thedevelopment of AD-associated neurodegenerative conditions through dysregulation of neuroinflammation.Although severe injuries and recurrent infections are likely triggers of prolonged immune activation, atopicdiseases, such as food allergy, asthma, and eczema, also cause chronic systemic inflammation and maycontribute to the development of AD pathology, especially when the diseases are not controlled properly. Mildlyallergic individuals do not always display severely uncomfortable or life-threatening reactions, and thereforemay inadvertently expose themselves to offending allergens repeatedly by being unaware of theirhypersensitivities or unconcerned with allergen avoidance. Thus, we hypothesize that chronic allergenexposure consumption by mildly allergic individuals potentiates the risk for development or progression of AD-related pathology via sustained systemic inflammation. While clinical studies have shown that atopic diseases,particularly eczema, are associated with AD, the link between food allergy and AD has not been fullyaddressed. In this proposed project, we will test our hypothesis using our mouse model of non-anaphylacticmild cow?s milk allergy (mCMA), in which C57BL\\/6J mice are sensitized to a whey protein, ?-lactoglobulin(BLG). We have previously shown that BLG-sensitized mice develop peripheral and central inflammation withinduced serum levels of BLG-specific IgE and IgG1, despite the lack of overt allergic reactions upon challenge.Moreover, these mCMA mice are able to eat allergen-containing food without displaying detectable physicalsymptoms or taste aversion, serving as an excellent model to simulate mildly allergic individuals with continuedexposure to the offending allergen. Using this experimental mCMA paradigm on wild-type C57BL\\/6J strain anda transgenic AD mouse model, the AppNL-G-F strain, we will first determine whether the extent of intestinal andsystemic inflammation is exacerbated by chronic allergen exposure in a duration- and age- dependent manner(Aim 1). We will further examine whether continued feeding of allergen-containing food will potentiate declinein cognitive behavior and exacerbate AD-like neuropathology (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study willinvestigate food allergy with chronic allergen exposure as a risk factor for AD and may offer a novel strategy toprevent or slow the progression of disease.--Project NarrativeContinued consumption of food allergens by mildly allergic individuals may increase the risk for Alzheimer?sdisease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders via chronic intestinal; systemic; and brain inflammation.Longer durations of allergen consumption; aging and genetic predispositions may further potentiate the risk. Inthis project; we aim to determine whether consistent intestinal insults with a food allergen contribute to theprogression of AD-like pathology in a mildly food-allergic mice; and whether the duration of allergen exposureand age of mice are additional factors for exacerbating AD-like symptoms in Alzheimer?s mouse model.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is a rapidly-growing and serious worldwide malady, which is currently the mostcommon cause of dementia in patients of advanced age. Patients develop brain pathology mediated by theamyloid ? (A?) protein, the function of which has recently been reported to include a type of host defense againstmicrobial invaders of the brain, as part of the innate immune response. One component of the innate immuneresponse that is important against microbial infections is the MR1\\/MAIT cell axis. MR1 is a majorhistocompatibility complex class I-like molecule that presents microbial vitamin B-derived metabolites to aninvariant T cell subpopulation called, ?mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells?. We have found that MR1gene expression is upregulated in the temporal cortex of both AD patients and 8-month old 5XFAD (AD model)mice. Moreover, MAIT cells can be found in the brains of normal, wildtype mice. The MR1 protein is expressedon the surface of astrocytes and microglia isolated from the brain, and each cell type is capable of presentingmicrobial antigens that activate MAIT cells in an MR1-dependent manner. Considering the variety of studiesthat have reported defects in the blood-brain barrier in the elderly, AD patients and AD mouse models, alongwith the presence of infectious agents in the AD brain and putative anti-microbial role for A?, we are focused onunderstanding the role of the MR1\\/MAIT cell axis in AD pathology development. For this, we will use the 5XFADAD mouse model system. Our hypothesis is that the MR1\\/MAIT cell axis contributes to AD pathology. As aresult, we predict that in an MR1-deficient environment (i.e., MR1 knockout 5XFAD mice), there will be anattenuation of AD symptoms. To address this hypothesis, we have proposed the following two Specific Aims:1. Determine the functional capacity of brain cells from 5XFAD mice to stimulate MAIT cells in an MR1-restrictedmanner; 2. Define AD development in MR1-deficient 5XFAD mice. These studies will allow us to determine thecontribution of the MR1\\/MAIT cell axis in AD development, using this mouse model. We then will use what welearn here as a springboard to the development of more in-depth mechanistic studies, focused on role of thisinnate immune axis in AD.--The elderly; especially Alzheimer?s disease patients; are more susceptible to bacterial infections. This may bedue to the stimulation of certain immune cells. Our goal in this application is to study how the immune systemcontributes to Alzheimer?s disease development and its response to changes in bacteria that normally reside inthe body.\"},{\"abstract\":\"AbstractAlthough the lifespan of individuals living with HIV-1 has increased significantly owing to effective combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), paradoxically however, in almost 50% of infected individuals there is increased prevalenceof HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), which remains an important comorbidity. It is suggested thatpersistence of cytotoxic viral protein such as HIV-1 Tat that accumulates despite cART, could likely contribute to thisprocess. Additionally, reports on Alzheimer?s like pathology in patients with HAND are also extant, likely attributableto the action of both HIV-1 infection and the cytotoxic viral Tat protein in neurons and endothelial cells. A recent studyfrom our lab has shown that HIV-1 Tat could also induce amyloidosis in yet another cell type, the astrocytes, via theHIF-1?-BACE1-antisense (AS) pathway in an in vitro model. Validation of these findings was also demonstrated inthe brains of SIV-infected macaques & HIV-infected patients? samples, and this amyloids could be an importantcontributing factor to neurotoxicity associated with HAND. Based on our recent report that astrocytes can produceamyloids following exposure to Tat, we hypothesized that the toxic amyloid forms secreted by Tat-stimulatedastrocytes in the astrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (ADEVs) could be taken up by the neuorns, resulting inexacerbated neuronal injury. The concept of uptake by neurons of astrocyte released amyloids via the ADEVs is anovel idea and has never been explored before. In this exploratory R21 proposal, we will test the hypothesis in twoaims: Aim 1: a) Determine how HIF-1? regulates HIV-1 Tat-mediated release of ADEVs carrying neurotoxic amyloids(A? 1-42) cargoes which, in turn, can be taken up by the neurons, leading to synaptodendritic injury, and Aim 2: b)Determine how the delivery of HIF-1A siRNA via the ADEV cargoes can inhibit amyloidosis and the associatedcognitive decline in two relevant rodent models of HAND- inducible transgenic Tat mice model as well as thehumanized mice model of HIV infection. These findings could have ramifications for future development of adjunctivetherapeutic interventions targeting astrocytic HIF-1? for treatment of neurological disorders in HIV patients on cARTtherapy.--NarrativeA recent study from our lab have identified the contribution of astrocytes in the Alzheimer?s like pathology (whichis a co-morbidity of HIV); in patients who are on combined antiretroviral therapy (cART); with lower\\/ undetectableviral titre; however; the role of astrocyte derived extracellular vesicles carrying this amyloid cargoes in HIVassociated neurological disorders; remains an enigma. In the proposed project; we will assess how HIF-1?regulates HIV-Tat mediated release of extracellular bodies from these astrocytes carrying amyloids which canlead to neuronal injury resulting in cognitive dysfunction; and additionally; how delivery of HIF-1 siRNA via ADEVsin the humanized mice model of infection can lead to protection of amyloidosis and cognitive dysfunction.

These effects pose a real threat to healthy aging, not only for the OSA patientbut also the bedpartner, as 61% of adults share a bed with a spouse\\/ partner. Despite the ?shared? nature ofOSA, treatments for OSA have nearly exclusively focused on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need forinterventions that address the impact of OSA and its treatment on both partners. Moreover, the first-linetreatment for OSA, positive airway pressure (PAP), is highly effective but profoundly inadequate to reduce thehealth and societal costs of OSA, as >50% of patients are non-adherent. Couples-based adherenceinterventions, such as those used in other chronic health conditions, have been demonstrated to be moreeffective in improving patient adherence, and may have additional benefits for the partner and for the health ofthe couple. This R21 proposal aims to develop, refine, and test the preliminary efficacy of a novel couples?-based intervention (We-PAP) compared to a patient-focused information control group (IC). We-PAP is the firstintervention which explicitly incorporates the partner into treatment (e.g. setting shared goals), and targets PAPadherence and overall sleep health of the couple as a whole. We-PAP is based on a transdiagnostic modeldesigned to treat the shared components of multiple disorders rather than a single disorder. This treatmentmay be particularly important for older adults, patients and partners alike, due to increased risk for insomniaand other sleep disorders in this population. We hypothesize that addressing the treatment of OSA in thecontext of couples? shared sleep experience will improve patient PAP adherence and the couples? sleep health.In turn, we hypothesize that couples randomized to We-PAP will show measurable improvements in criticallyimportant outcomes in the context of aging, including clinically relevant cognitive outcomes, relationshipquality, and QOL. Results of this R21 will be used to inform the design of a subsequent fully powered clinicaltrial of this novel intervention. Findings could significantly advance current clinical practice in the treatment ofOSA and this intervention may be useful for improving sleep in other aging populations with multiple sleepdisorders, including patients with or at risk for Alzheimer?s disease and their caregivers.--Project NarrativeObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a serious and debilitating health condition that affects both patients and theirbedpartners' sleep; quality of life and health risk; including cardiovascular and Alzheimer?s disease.

This system is believed to comprise (i) dural and meningeal lymphatic vessels that drain CSF andinterstitial fluid (ISF) toward cervical lymph nodes and which may (ii) communicate with the recently-proposedglymphatic system, an aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-mediated system that facilitates CSF-ISF efflux from periarterial toperivenous spaces and ultimately to cervical lymphatic vessels and nodes. While multiple independent studieshave speculated that the CNS lymphatic system may have relevance to clearance conditions of unknownetiology in humans (including but not limited to sleep disorders, CSF clearance disorders, multiple sclerosis,Parkinson's disease, and ADRD), limited direct information is available on the relevance of this system to thesedisorders in humans. The critical barrier to addressing this problem rests with a general lack of imagingmethods that can be applied to interrogate multiple aspects of the proposed human CNS lymphatic system invivo. As such, even basic knowledge about how this system changes with age, sex, and behavioral stateremain debated, and these limitations preclude identification of pathological features in patients. Very recently,we have translated non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods optimized in prior work forevaluating peripheral blood and lymphatic circulatory dysfunction to the CNS. We have quantified measures ofintracranial glymphatic function in 61 older adults with Parkinson's disease (PD), with and without associatedcognitive dysfunction, and have provided evidence that PD patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment(aMCI) have significantly reduced markers of intracranial glymphatic function compared to age-matchedpatients without aMCI, and also that markers of glymphatic flow velocity inversely correlate with brainA? burden quantified from gold-standard PET imaging. These findings provide a foundation in which novel,non-invasive markers can be applied to understand lymphatic function in healthy tissue and also in thepresence of increased brain A? burden. As such, the goal of this work is to apply novel MRI and establishedPET approaches to evaluate (i) how the CNS lymphatic system varies with age and sex for healthy aging, andsubsequently the clinical relevance of CNS lymphatic function on (ii) brain A? burden and (ii) behavioral statein PD patients with cognitive impairment, a recognized ADRD. Study findings will provide fundamental insightsinto the behavior of the CNS lymphatic system in humans with and without ADRD. More broadly, the methodsdeveloped and refined will provide a support structure for the growing number of studies seeking to interrogateCNS lymphatic function, but where current imaging tools lack sufficient sensitivity.--NARRATIVERecent immunological and physiological studies have provided evidence in support of a central nervoussystem (CNS) lymphatic drainage system in vertebrate animals; and preliminary evidence has suggested thata similar system exists in humans. If operative; this system may have central relevance to many vascular andfluid clearance disorders such as stroke; multiple sclerosis; Parkinson's disease; and Alzheimer's diseaserelated dementia (ADRD): diseases which represent some of the most pressing healthcare challenges of the21st century. Evaluating this possibility will require improved; robust imaging methods sensitive to lymphaticdrainage dysfunction; as such; the goal of this work is to apply novel magnetic resonance imaging approaches;optimized already for evaluating lymphatic circulation in patients with peripheral lymphatic dysfunction; toquantify relationships between physiological hallmarks of ADRD and CNS lymphatic function in humans.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryRemyelination failure is the hallmark of microvascular white matter injury (WMI) and commonly causescognitive impairment and dementia in the elderly. We propose that remyelination failure involves twocomplementary mechanisms that generate hyaluronic acid fragments (HAf) that disrupt the maturation ofoligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). First, we hypothesize that vascular endothelial cells generate HAf inresponse to oxidative stress. Second, we hypothesize that vascular injury activates HAf-mediated mechanismsthat promote vascular lumen adhesion and trafficking of lymphocytes to cause white matter inflammation andreactive astrocytosis to enhance HA\\/HAf levels. We will focus on human WMI confirmed by ante-mortem MRI-defined white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). WMHs are the most widely used clinical predictor of risk forvascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We will define aberrant HAf-mediated actions related tocerebrovascular dysfunction in WMHs. We will build upon two recent advances. First, we will undertakenovel vascular physiology studies to define oxidative stress in arterioles isolated from human WMHs.We showed that WM arterioles from VCID cases selectively displayed reduced endothelium-mediatedvasodilation that predisposes to WMI (Ann Neurol 83:142-152, 2018). Second, we will define aberrant HAf-mediated mechanisms of myelination failure related to cerebrovascular dysfunction in WMHs. We havedefined a signaling pathway activated by cerebral ischemia where a specific bioactive HAf cell autonomouslyblocks OPC maturation to cause myelination failure (J Clin Invest 128:2025-2041, 2018). We will thus utilizeour unique expertise in quantitation and analysis of HA fragments to determine the specific sizes that arelinked to myelination failure in WMHs through mechanisms involving the OPC-vascular niche. In aim 1, we willemploy a combination of molecular and morphometric approaches to test the hypothesis that remyelinationfailure in WMHs arises from disrupted HA metabolism that mediates aberrant OPC proliferation andblocks differentiation to myelinating oligodendrocytes. We will isolate vascular endothelial cell-derivedHAf from WMHs and determine its actions on OPC proliferation and differentiation. In aim 2, we will utilize acombination of molecular, biochemical and histochemical approaches to test the hypothesis that WM vasculardysfunction and oxidative\\/nitrosative stress are linked to altered HA synthesis, catabolism andsignaling in WMHs. In aim 3, we will employ novel murine and human in vitro models to test the hypothesisthat dysfunction of WM arterioles promotes inflammatory mechanisms of myelination failure mediated byvascular lumen adhesion and trafficking of lymphocytes into WMHs. Our over-riding objective is to provide amechanistic molecular explanation for the distinct OPC-vascular processes that render aging human whitematter particularly susceptible to microvascular WMI in order to develop therapies that promote OPCmaturation and mitigate remyelination failure associated with cognitive decline in VCID.--Project NarrativeThis proposal focuses on recently discovered mechanisms of impaired regeneration and repair of diffusehuman white matter lesions that we propose are central to vascular brain injury and cognitive declineassociated with aging and vascular dementia. We will employ pioneering vascular physiology and molecularapproaches to define how chronic injury and inflammation of human white matter blood vessels contributes tothe progression of white matter injury by studying MRI-defined lesions from human autopsy brains frompatients confirmed to have cognitive decline. The role of disrupted white matter blood flow will be related todisrupted maturation of a key brain cell type (the oligodendrocyte progenitor) that appears to play a central rolein aberrant brain recovery (remyelination failure) after white matter injury to be defined by MRI.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Identifying the specific aspects of sleep that relate to incident dementia is the first step towards the developmentof sleep interventions to reduce dementia risk. Detailed overnight sleep studies, known as polysomnography(PSG), provide the gold-standard assessment of sleep. As obtaining PSG is burdensome, studies with PSG tendto enroll a limited number of participants and consequently have limited statistical power to detect small butpotentially important associations between sleep and dementia. We propose to curate data from 5 largepopulation-based cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, Cardiovascular Health Study, FraminghamHeart Study, Osteoporotic Fractures in Men, and the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures) with methodologicallyconsistent sleep studies and neurocognitive outcomes. By combining study-level data in meta-analysis, wepropose the following aims: Aim 1 is to examine the aspects of sleep that relate to a higher risk of incidentAlzheimer's disease (AD) dementia (N=2776, 499 incident cases). We will capture 134 sleep metrics,measuring all aspects of sleep neurophysiology. We will then identify clusters and calculate the first principalcomponent from each cluster as the exposers. We will further assess the association between cluster specificsleep metrics and outcomes using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression 1.a. Wewill examine each aspect of sleep neurophysiology with respect to the risk of incident AD dementia, afteraccounting for known confounders. 1.b. We will leverage our statistical power to explore differences by agedecades, sex, and genetic risk (e.g., APOE ?4 positivity). Aim 2 is to examine the aspects of sleep (definedin Aim 1) that relate cross-sectionally to dementia endophenotypes. As poor sleep is potentially modifiable,it is important to know whether poor sleep is related to preclinical phenotypes of dementia?a time whendementia risk may still be malleable. Brain atrophy on MRI and subtle deficits in cognitive ability precededementia diagnosis by up to a decade. We will relate each sleep marker to general and domain-specific cognitiveperformance (N=6723) as well as brain volume (total brain and hippocampal) and brain injury (white matterdisease, silent infarcts) on MRI (N=1157). Aim 3 is to examine whether changes in sleep neurophysiologyover ~6 years predict incident dementia (N=1558, 275 events), cognition (N=3065), or brain volume(N=763). Leveraging repeated PSGs ~6 years apart, we will examine if changes in sleep neurophysiology relateto incident AD dementia, brain volume, or cognitive function. Our large analysis of community-based participantsfrom across the U.S. will provide the most robust evidence yet on the associations between sleep and ADdementia risk. Moreover, leveraging our large pooled sample size to examine subgroup differences (e.g., by agedecades, sex and APOE) and the comprehensive investigation of sleep neurophysiology, including innovativesleep measures (e.g., spindle density), may inform therapeutic strategies for dementia prevention by identifyingsubgroups most at risk, new biomarkers to improve dementia risk stratification, and novel biological pathways.--PROJECT NARRATIVEIdentifying the specific aspects of sleep that relate to incident dementia is the first step towards thedevelopment of sleep interventions to reduce dementia risk. We propose to bring together 5 large community-based cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study; Cardiovascular Health Study; Framingham HeartStudy; Study of Osteoporotic Fractures; and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study) with methodologicallyconsistent polysomnographic studies and neurocognitive outcomes to comprehensively examine 134traditional (e.g.; REM and slow wave sleep percentage) and novel (e.g.; EEG spectral activity; slowoscillations; and spindle density) sleep biomarkers with respect to incident Alzheimer's dementia and itscognitive and brain MRI endophenotypes in non-demented participants. This research could help us to betterunderstand Alzheimer's disease biology and to identify new biomarkers and treatment targets.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryPericytes are specialized mural cells in the basement membrane of brain capillaries. Their contact andcommunication with the endothelium is critical for multiple aspects of vascular function, including control ofmicrovascular blood flow and blood-brain barrier integrity. There is significant evidence that increased loss ofpericytes occurs during Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's-related dementias, and that this loss causesaccelerated degradation of microvascular integrity, leading to neuronal dysfunction. Preserving pericyte-endothelial contact may therefore improve cerebrovascular function in these neurodegenerative diseases.However, there remain fundamental gaps in knowledge on how the adult brain responds to and recovers frompericyte loss in vivo. We recently discovered that pericytes of the brain undergo a repair strategy to maintaincoverage of the endothelium in the event of pericyte loss (Berthiaume et al. Cell Reports, 2018, 22(1):8-16).Pericytes can structurally remodel their far-reaching processes to invade endothelial regions that lack pericytecontact. The goal of this project is to investigate this novel facet of brain pericyte biology and its role inmaintenance of capillary function. Our innovative approach will assess the effect of pericyte loss and repair in acompletely physiological setting. We will use high-resolution, in vivo two-photon microscopy to image andselectively ablate pericytes, while assessing capillary hemodynamics, tissue oxygenation, and neural synapticactivity. This approach provides an exceptionally clear view of how the brain responds to pericyte loss, and thereparative responses that are mounted over days. In Aim 1, we will determine how the pericyte remodelingmechanism manages graded increases in severity of pericyte loss. We will examine the physiologicalconsequence of this pericyte loss on capillary flow, structure and integrity, and determine whether the repaircapacity is diminished with increasing age. In Aim 2, we will examine how pericyte loss alters themicrostructure of tissue oxygen distribution and neuronal synaptic function using novel imaging probes. In Aim3, we will determine whether pericyte remodeling is altered by activation or inhibition of PDGF-B\\/PDGFR?, akey signaling pathway for developmental recruitment of pericytes to their peri-endothelial niche. If successful,our aims will establish whether it is useful to restore pericyte coverage in conditions such as Alzheimer'sdisease and related dementias. We will obtain information on how selective pericyte loss in adult and agedbrain affects the dynamics of capillary function. Finally, we will establish novel methods to quantify andmanipulate pericyte remodeling, allowing the phenomenon to be studied broadly in other models ofcerebrovascular disease.--PROJECT NARRATIVEPericytes are a key cell type in the capillary wall; and their deficiency during Alzheimer?s disease leads toimpairment of important vascular functions; such as blood-brain barrier integrity and regulation of blood flow.This project uses cutting-edge live imaging to study the dynamics of brain pericytes in live mice; with the goalof revealing how the brain responds and adapts to pericyte loss. It will also test whether augmentation ofpericyte-endothelial coverage can improve capillary health and function in adult and aged

Summary\\/AbstractPostoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a debilitating condition that particularly plagues aged individuals(~40% of elderly surgical patients develop POCD). POCD substantially increases the risk of morbidity, mortality,and the development of Alzheimer?s disease. Inflammation in the brain (?neuroinflammation?), which becomesmore excitable or ?primed? with age, may cause POCD. Indeed, substantial changes in the immune system occurwith age and the immune system communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) and alters the functionof local CNS immune cells such as microglia. In modern society, unusually clean conditions decrease exposureto environmental and commensal microorganisms that help shape immunoregulatory circuits. Reintroduction ofmicroorganisms in an overly sterile environment can improve immunoregulation and quell hyperactiveinflammatory responses. Despite the therapeutic potential of specific small microbes, few studies have assessedwhether microbial-based treatment strategies target the CNS and are effective in aged populations. One suchmicrobe that could benefit neuroinflammation in aging is the widely distributed soil bacterium Mycobacteriumvaccae (M. vaccae), which is approved for therapeutic use in humans and improves quality of life in othercontexts (allergy and cancer). Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that M. vaccae immunotherapy(three subcutaneous injections) will protect against primed neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in aged ratsfollowing surgery. Our preliminary results indicate that M. vaccae immunotherapy has robust and sustained anti-inflammatory activity (+IL-4) in the CNS of aged rats and blocks persistent pro-inflammatory responses (IL-1?)and cognitive deficits following surgery. M. vaccae appears to induce a beneficial (anti-inflammatory) CNSresponse and redirect the activation state of microglia. M. vaccae enhances immunoregulation in the bodythrough altering T cell populations and may shift the population of T cells accessing the CNS and surroundingmeningeal space to elicit changes in the CNS. Thus, this proposal addresses the following specific aims: first,establish whether M. vaccae is a viable pre-clinical target for preventing age-associated POCD; second, identifythe CNS-specific mechanisms by which M. vaccae induces a sustained protective shift in the aged neuroimmuneenvironment; and third, establish how M. vaccae communicates its anti-inflammatory signal to the brain. Thisresearch is innovative: microbial-based treatments can effectively improve peripheral inflammation, yet there isalmost no research investigating whether microbial-based treatments can protect against damagingneuroinflammation. Our overall long-term goals are to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanismsunderlying neuroinflammatory priming; to understand how microglia function transitions toward pathologicalresponses with age; and to determine how these neuroimmune alterations hijack behavioral function.--Project NarrativeIn modern sanitary conditions; humans (and laboratory rodents) no longer encounter entire classes ofenvironmental and commensal microorganisms that can shape effective and appropriate immunoregulatorycircuits. This reduction in microbial input may drive development of hyperactive pathological neuroinflammatoryresponses and associated behavioral deficits (cognitive impairments; depression; etc.). Here we will reveal inrats whether a microbial-based treatment strategy; that is approved for use in humans (Mycobacterium vaccaeimmunotherapy; NCTC 11659); prevents age-associated neuroinflammation and postoperative cognitivedecline.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Mast cells (MCs) play important roles in allergic responses. Recent studies suggest that MCs are alsoessential to other inflammatory diseases by releasing inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and the MC-specific proteases chymase and tryptase after degranulation. Pharmacological inactivation of MCs prevents orslows disease progression. Alzheimer?s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and disability inthe elderly. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S., affecting more than 5 million Americans alone,according to the Alzheimer?s Association. One definitive diagnosis of AD is based on the presence ofextracellular deposition of neurotoxic ?-amyloid (A?) into senile plaques. Human AD brains have elevatedprotease expression, neuronal death and synapse loss, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, and activation ofinflammatory cells such as microglia, astrocytes, and T cells. MCs also present in human AD brains, mainly inthe hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus, but studies have yet to test whether these cells participatedirectly in the pathogenesis or serve merely as another inflammatory hallmark. Our preliminary datademonstrated that the plasma levels of MC activator IgE and MC granular contents tryptase and histaminewere elevated in patients with early stage AD, indicating enhanced systemic MC activation. Anti-tryptase andCD117 antibodies detected MC accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus from human and murine ADbrains. Using MC-deficient KitW-sh\\/W-sh mice and over-the-counter (OTC) MC inhibitor ketotifen, wedemonstrated that the absence or pharmacological inhibition of MCs reduced A? deposition and senile plaqueformation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and reduced the numbers of total Iba-1-positive microgliaand CD68-positive phagocytic microglia in these regions in APPSWE-PS1?e9+\\/? (APP-PS1) mice that developcerebral amyloidosis. Brain tissue extract ELISA showed that the absence of MCs reduced the production ofpathological A? species (A?1-40 and A?1-42). Adoptive transfer of in vitro-prepared MCs into KitW-sh\\/W-shAPP-PS1-recipient mice restored cortical and hippocampal A? deposition, microglia infiltration and activation, and ADbrain cortex A?1-40 and A?1-42 contents. A preliminary water T-maze behavior test suggested that MC depletionimproved cognitive decline in APP-PS1 mice. We hypothesize that MCs play a pathogenic role in AD byreleasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases, and MC inhibition with the anti-allergy drugs may becomea novel therapy of human AD. We propose three aims to examine whether MC depletion or inhibition protectsmice from Alzheimer?s disease; to examine whether genetic deficiency of Fc?R1 or anti-IgE antibody therapyprotects mice from Alzheimer?s disease and, to establish the mechanistic link between mast cell activation andmouse Alzheimer?s disease.--Brain tissues or plasma samples from patients and mice with Alzheimer?s disease (AD) contain increasedlevels of mast cells (MCs); MC activator IgE; IgE receptor Fc?R1; and MC activation products. Our preliminarystudies demonstrated that MC-deficiency or inhibition with an over-the-counter human anti-allergy drugZaditor\\u00c2\\u00ae improved AD-like pathologies and memory loss in mice. This proposal will test the hypothesis thatMCs play a direct role in AD pathogenesis and the human anti-allergy drugs may have therapeutic potential in AD patients.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARYAs the prevalence of late-onset Alzheimer?s disease continues to increase, understanding the mechanisticcauses of this disease is becoming increasingly critical. Recent clinical studies have linked increased stiffnessof the large arteries to both impaired memory and Alzheimer?s disease. It is hypothesized that these relationsare a result of large artery stiffness-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction. Increased large artery stiffness leadsto greater pulsatility of pressure and blood flow in the cerebral vasculature, which is known to cause vasculardamage. Dysfunction of the cerebral arteries and microvasculature is associated with cognitive impairment andgreater Alzheimer?s disease-related neuropathology. Furthermore, amyloid-? (A?) induces cerebrovasculardamage, and cerebrovascular impairment increases A? accumulation, thus creating a vicious cycle ofcerebrovascular dysfunction and neuropathology. The goal of the proposed studies is to provide the first proof-of-concept evidence that age-related increases in large artery stiffness, synergistically with greater A?production, lead to cognitive impairment, neuropathology, and cerebrovascular dysfunction. To accomplish thisgoal, we will employ transgenic mouse models of greater large artery stiffness and greater A? production, aswell as use a pharmacological intervention to prevent age-related increases in large artery stiffness. In Aim 1,we will assess the effects of large artery stiffness, in combination with A?, on cognitive dysfunction andAlzheimer?s disease-related neuropathology. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of large artery stiffness, incombination with A?, on cerebral blood flow and cerebral vascular reactivity and structural integrity. In Aim 3,we will identify candidate mechanisms by which large artery stiffness and greater cerebral artery pulsatility leadto cerebrovascular dysfunction. To do so, we will examine the role and source(s) of vascular oxidative stress,as well as perform transcriptome analysis of cerebral arteries and microvascular endothelial cells. Theknowledge to be gained by completing the proposed aims will inform future studies to identify novel therapeutictargets for the prevention or attenuation of late-onset Alzheimer?s disease.--PROJECT NARRATIVEWith aging; there is increased stiffness of the large arteries (i.e.; the aorta and carotid arteries) and stiffer largearteries are associated with Alzheimer?s disease and problems with memory. The proposed studies willdetermine; for the first time; the cause-and-effect relation between large artery stiffness and impairments in thebrain. The knowledge gained from these studies will help identify new methods to prevent or treat Alzheimer?sdisease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTRole of REV-ERB Proteins in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer?s DiseaseCircadian rhythm disruption is observed in Alzheimer?s Disease, and emerging data suggests that circadiandysfunction may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. However, mechanisms connecting circadiandysfunction to Alzheimer?s Disease-related neurodegeneration remain unclear. On a molecular level, corecircadian clock genes mediate circadian rhythms, and also serve as critical transcriptional and metabolicregulators in a variety of organs, including the brain. We have shown that genetic disruption of the circadianclock by deletion of the master clock gene Bmal1 causes severe gliosis, oxidative damage, and synapticdegeneration in mouse brain, suggesting a link between core clock function and neurodegeneration. We havesubsequently found that the deletion of REV-ERB?, a component of the core clock which is directly regulatedby BMAL1, also causes spontaneous microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Our data shows that REV-ERB? expression is suppressed in the cortex of amyloid plaque-bearing APP\\/PS1 mice, a model ofAlzheimer?s Disease, and in activated microglia. REV-ERB? and its homolog REV-ERB? are nuclear receptorswhich, aside from their function in the circadian clock, have been implicated in regulation of inflammation andmetabolism. We hypothesize that REV-ERBs serve to link the circadian clock to neuroinflammation andneurodegeneration. We will examine the cell-autonomous function of REV-ERBs in regulating microglialactivation and neuroinflammation, and identify transcriptional pathways regulated by REV-ERBs in microglia.We will determine if REV-ERBs control microglial synaptic phagocytosis in the brain via transcriptionalregulation of complement genes. Because they are nuclear receptors, REV-ERBs can be manipulatedpharmacologically. Thus, we will examine the effects of cell type specific genetic deletion of REV-ERBs, oractivation or inhibition of REV-ERB function with small molecule agonists, on neuroinflammation andneurodegeneration in a mouse model of Alzheimer?s Disease. These studies will shed new light on molecularmechanisms linking the circadian clock and Alzheimer?s Disease-related neurodegeneration, and illuminate thenovel strategy of directly targeting the circadian clock for neuroprotection.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThe circadian clock controls 24-hour rhythms in the body; and is an important regulator of brainfunction. We hypothesize that disturbances in circadian function; which are common in ourmodern society; can promote neurodegenerative diseases; in particular Alzheimer?s Disease.We will investigate the functions of a certain set of ?clock proteins?; termed REV-ERBs; whichcontrol circadian rhythms in the brain; and determine molecular mechanisms by which they mayinfluence neuroinflammation in Alzheimer?s Disease. We hope to use novel therapies to directlyactivate or block the function of these REV-ERB proteins to prevent Alzheimer?s Disease andother neurodegenerative diseases.\"},{\"abstract\":\"An exciting new area in neurodegenerative disease research is the emerging phenomenon of prion-like spreading of neurodegenerative disease proteins. Prions are well established as the protein-based infectious agent underlying the spongioform encephalopathies. In these rare, albeit devastating, diseases the prion protein converts from the normal soluble form to the aggregated self-templating infectious form. This process initiates an inexorable spread of pathology and contingent neurodegeneration throughout the brain. But could this disease mechanism extend to the morecommon neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson?s disease (PD) and Alzheimer?s disease and related dementia? If so, it represents a game changer in terms of understanding disease mechanisms and opens many new avenues for therapeutic development. However, any therapeutic or mechanistic investigation into prion-like spreading will require the development of powerful new imaging approaches to track the path of prion-like spread and understand how these protein aggregates alter brain function as they spread. We will need to understand why they take some routes but not others and how this impacts brain function. To address this challenge, we have formed an interdisciplinary team, consisting of an engineer and a geneticist. First, we will use state of the art brain clearing technology to obtainhigh-resolution images of prion-like protein propagation of the Parkinson?s disease protein ?-synuclein. We will monitor these aggregates as they spread from one neuron to the next, tracking their paths. These high-resolution brain wide 3D maps of alpha-synuclein spreading will empower us to identify gene expression patterns associated with spreading paths and to nominate genes for functional studies. Then, we will utilize advanced high-resolution optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) to reveal the longitudinal effects of prion-like spreading on brain network activity andlikewise the impact of neural activity on prion-like spreading. Our experiments will provide fundamental mechanistic insight into prion-like spread of neurodegenerative disease. The tools we apply and the lessons we learn will likely be broadly applicable to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias.--An exciting new area in neurodegenerative disease research is the emerging phenomenon of prion-like spreading of neurodegenerative disease proteins.

Whilesubstantial evidence exists that peripheral insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) exacerbate age-relatedcognitive decline and ADRD (Alzheimer?s Disease and Related Dementia), ascertaining causation by eitherimpaired central IIS or ?metabolic sequelae? of peripheral metabolic disease requires model systems that canyield mechanistic insights. Above all, experimental systems are required that allow measurement ofparameters relevant to human cognitive impairment across a range of well-controlled conditions. Our approachsatisfies this imperative through routinized analyses of hippocampal function?including partially hippocampus-dependent spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of thehippocampus (DG). These assays are validated by our preliminary studies on mice lacking Irs2 in neurons(nIrs2-\\/- mice), and extended in our approach to mice with unique central (neuronal) and peripheral (e.g.pancreas or liver) expression of Irs1 and Irs2, plus down-stream Foxo1. We moreover analyze directly centralIIS mediated by Irs1 and Irs2 in the hippocampus, together with its possible feedback regulation by multi-siteserine\\/threonine phosphorylation of Irs1 and Irs2 (pS\\/TIrs). AIM1 tests the possibly unique roles of neuronal Irs1and Irs2 to mediate central IIS?answering whether the benefits to hippocampal function of attenuatedneuronal IIS via Irs2 seen in nIrs2-\\/- mice owe to compensatory upregulation of neuronal IIS via Irs1. AIMs 2-3focus on the mechanistic significance of metabolic sequela. Since high blood glucose and compensatoryinsulin hypersecretion are prominent metabolic sequelae of T2D, AIM2 takes a novel approach to restore Irs2expression in beta cells (reducing glucose) or liver (reducing glucose and insulin) in diabetic Irs2 knockoutmice. AIM3 exploits our established LDKO and LTKO mouse models?which lack hepatic Irs1 and Irs2(diabetic) or Irs1 and Irs2, plus Foxo1 (non-diabetic). First, AIM 3 compares hippocampal function in LDKO vsLTKO mice created acutely using viral Cre. Second, since our published work supports a role of hepatic FoxO1and increased liver-secreted hepatokine follistatin (Fst) in propagating hepatic insulin resistance to othertissues, AIM 3 employs viral methods to restore FoxO1 expression in LTKO mice, or to knock down expressionof Fst in LDKO mice, investigating in detail the effects on hippocampal function. How insulin resistance anddiabetes promote cognitive decline is an important clinical and research question. Together, the proposedexperiments can elucidate connections between metabolic disease and cognitive dysfunction by dissectingroles of neuronal Irs1 and Irs2, and determining the specific influences of impaired peripheral insulin sensitivityand associated metabolic sequelae upon hippocampal function.--This proposal entitled `Regulation of hippocampal function by central and peripheral IRS signaling'; brings ourcore focus on insulin receptor substrates to bear on the medically important problem of how insulin resistanceand diabetes promote cognitive decline. Our proposal investigates the function of the insulin receptorsubstrates in the hippocampus and in peripheral tissues to regulate cognitive function in aged mice duringprogressive metabolic disease. Our approach employs mice with unique patterns of Irs1 and Irs2 expression todistinguish effects of neuronal versus peripheral insulin signaling. Our innovative experimental models canreveal new mechanistic insights that can guide development of targeted strategies to prevent cognitive declineduring diabetes.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTA bidirectional relationship exists between Alzheimer?s disease and sleep, where disrupted sleep increasesamyloid-beta (A?) and tau pathology and conversely, A? and tau aggregation disrupt sleep.

Many human genetic AD risk factors,including APOE, CLU, and TREM2, modulate neuroinflammation and\\/or the function of microglia, the centralnervous system (CNS) resident innate immune cell. Deletion of all peripheral adaptive immune cells (i.e. CD4+T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells) or T cell depletion (i.e. CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells) increased cognitive abilitiesin amyloidosis and tauopathy models, respectively, and were associated with altered microglial function.Interestingly, aging, another major AD risk factor, is associated with inflammation and we have found thatincreases in CNS CD8+ T cells found with aging is further exacerbated by amyloidosis. Additionally, enhancedCNS CD8+ T cells numbers are also found during tauopathy. We hypothesize that CD8+ T cells impactcognition and CNS sequelae during tauopathy and age-associated amyloidosis. We predict that CD8+ T cellsalter microglia function and transcriptomes as a mechanism for disease modulation. To address thishypothesis, we will utilize aged wild type (WT) control mice, aged APPNL-F\\/NL-F mice, which express humanamyloid precursor protein (APP) or our AAV1 model of tauopathy, respectively, on a normal WT or CD8-\\/-background, to eliminate CD8+ T cells. We will also conduct similar studies on an OT-I background whichcontains CD8+ T cells that are not stimulated through their T cell receptor (TCR).

Multiple risk factors through still not wellunderstood molecular mechanisms are known to influence the individual susceptibility for sporadic AD. One ofthe often-overlooked contributors to AD pathophysiology is A? accumulation in the cerebrovasculature (CAA),present in >90% of AD cases. CAA imposes restriction in cerebral blood flow resulting in ischemic white matterlesions, microhemorrhages, enhanced neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Synaptic damagecorrelates with loss of cognitive function, is an early event in AD pathogenesis, and worsens with diseaseprogression. Oligomeric A? (oligA?) has emerged as the species capable to selectively disrupt synaptictransmission, triggering cascades of events that primarily affect mitochondrial function, disrupting ATPproduction, inducing caspase-3 activation, and affecting levels and distribution of synaptic components. Our ownpreliminary data in APP Tg lines demonstrate profound changes in pre-\\/post-synaptic markers, low ATP levelsand reduced mitochondrial activity in isolated synaptosomes. Highlighting the relevance of interlinked metabolicpathways, we show that hypoxic conditions drastically potentiate the detrimental effects of oligA?, exacerbatingROS production and inducing comparable toxicity by 500-fold lower A? doses than those required undernormoxia. The affected mechanisms are in part related to the protective redox sensor Nrf2 ? downregulated inAD ? as small-molecule Nrf2 activators rescue the in vitro phenotype under normoxic conditions. Notably,hypoxia triggers activation of the oxygen sensitive HIF-1? pathway via upregulation of Siah2, a hypoxia-induciblemolecule also capable of downregulating Nrf2. We hypothesize that progressive brain hypoperfusion as a resultof CAA precipitate A?-induced mitochondrial dysfunction via dysregulation of the Nrf2?HIF-1? oxidativestress\\/hypoxia protective response resulting in increased synaptic alterations, neuroinflammation, and vascularsusceptibility to microhemorrhages, events we postulate are amenable for translational interventions. Wepropose in vitro studies to identify the protective mechanisms exerted by small molecule Nrf2 activators underconditions mimicking hypoperfusion, assessing changes in global bioenergetics, functional impact in cell-specificbiological parameters, and regulatory shifts in Nrf2?HIF-1? paths modulated by the hypoxia-sensor Siah2. Datawill be validated in vivo in Tg models with progressive A? CAA using 1HMRS, conventional MRI, behavioralassessments, and LTP measurements, complemented by biochemical dissection of functional components ofthe mitochondrial machinery and Nrf2?HIF-1 paths, and their impact on synaptic changes and bioenergetics inisolated microvessels and synaptic mitochondria. Induction of hyperhomocysteinemia through a diet that resultsin cerebrovascular abnormalities, reduced oxygen delivery and cognitive deficits in non-Tg mice while enhancingCAA by relocation of A? deposits in Tg mice, will provide a complementary model to study vascular contributionto synaptic dysfunction independently or synergistically to the presence of CAA.--Mitochondria are essential organelles controlling cell bioenergetics and ROS homeostasis with particularrelevance in the brain; an organ that consumes high levels of energy and has little capacity for storage.Dysfunction of the microvasculature severely compromises cerebral blood flow; affecting the delivery of oxygenand nutrients and as a result damaging the integrity of the neurovascular unit.

SUMMARYAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with multiple pathologies, such asproteinaceous brain inclusions and neuroinflammation. The vascular system is also recognized as afactor in AD, yet there are few models to study the mechanism. We and others have found that the A?peptide, a known driver of AD, can activate the plasma contact system, which can lead to blood clotformation and inflammation via generation of bradykinin upon cleavage of high molecular weightkininogen (HK). There are three main lines of evidence that the contact system is involved in ADpathology: 1) A? activates factor XII (F12), which initiates the contact system; 2) AD patient plasmahas increased contact system activation compared to that of age-matched, non-demented individuals;and 3) Knockdown of the contact system using an anti-F12 antisense oligonucleotide ameliorates ADpathology in a mouse model. HK circulates in blood as a complex with other coagulation factors, andit serves as a non-enzymatic co-factor for the activation of these proteins. Compared to othercomponents of the contact system, depletion of HK offers more robust protection from blood clottingand inflammation due to its central role in both pathways.We have generated antibodies that are specific for cleaved HK that could help identify AD patientswith contact system involvement. We also have developed antibodies that block HK cleavage, whichmight be beneficial to patients as they might ameliorate some of the pathologies of AD. It is importantto note that people who lack a contact system are not prone to bleeding, and therefore, blocking thissystem in AD patients would not risk intracerebral hemorrhage.Despite decades of research, there are no effective treatments that slow or prevent AD. Progress intreating AD requires a multidisciplinary approach. We hypothesize that blocking the contact systemcould reduce vascular and inflammatory pathologies in AD patients. We propose to further developour anti-HK antibodies for AD patient diagnostic and therapeutic use.--PROJECT NARRATIVEThe Alzheimer's disease (AD) peptide; beta-amyloid; can activate the coagulation system; which can lead to 1)blood clotting and 2) inflammation upon cleavage of a particular protein. We have generated antibodies thatcan be used to quantitate the level of this protein in human blood as well as prevent cleavage and release ofthe inflammatory molecule. These antibodies could be beneficial to patients; since they may diagnose AD priorto cognitive symptoms as well as therapeutically lessen inflammation and protect against abnormal bloodclotting; both of which are AD pathologies.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation ofamyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Current consensus is that the AD pathological process beginsdecades before clinical symptoms occur. This long ?preclinical? phase of AD can first be observable in middle-age as deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) in the transentorhinal cortex and subcortical nuclei such asthe locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. We have strong preliminary evidence showing thathigher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau in cognitively normal older adults (mean age: 69.6\\u00c2\\u00b18.6 years) areassociated with poorer REM sleep and sleep spindles characteristics, the same processes influenced by the LC.We also have broad evidence of lower NET uptake in the LC associated with stress and aging. Our study modelposes that early onset of tauopathy in the LC results in chronic upregulation of LC activity. This would reflecton disruption of the two sleep phenomena dependent on LC silences (REM sleep and sleep spindles), alsoclosely related to cognition and memory formation, as well as performance in task-attention tests. Further, wehypothesize that the now mostly accepted LC tracer [11C] MRB developed and extensively tested by our team,will show decreased uptake in the LC associated with CSF tau biomarkers and LC tonic and phasic dysfunction.We propose to test this hypothesis first by demonstrating that increases in CSF tau are associated in vivo withlower [11C]MRB PET uptake (Aim 1), and that lower [11C] MRB binding in the LC is associated with impairedREM sleep and sleep spindles characteristics (Aim 2), as well as lower measures of performance in task-relatedattention tests (Aim 3). To test these hypotheses, 30 older adults (age 60-75) balanced by sex, will first performa full clinical evaluation and MRI (visits 1-2). Subjects will later undergo 7 days of actigraphy followed bynocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) (visit 3). A morning lumbar puncture (LP) will be performed after NPSGto obtain CSF, followed by attention tests. LC function will be analyzed by PET-MR using [11C] MRB, whichwill be performed 1-4 weeks after the LP (visit 4). There is the potential to identify: 1) an association betweenCSF tau and in vivo [11C] MRB uptake; 2) a mechanism by which tau pathology may contribute to sleepdysfunction; 3) evidence that LC dysfunction disrupts performance in attention tests; and, 4) LC dysfunction asa new therapeutic target for AD prevention.--PROJECT NARRATIVE Growing evidence suggests that Alzheimer?s disease (AD) pathological changes begin decades before clinicalsymptoms and tau abnormalities in the locus coeruleus (LC) can be observed since midlife. We have previouslydemonstrated functional vulnerability of the LC to aging and stress; as well as an association between higher CSFtau and impaired sleep phenomena influenced by the LC. We now aim to test whether LC dysfunction can bemeasured in preclinical AD stages by LC targeted imaging; and whether it objectively affects sleep architectureand attention; by asking 30 cognitively normal older adults to perform a full clinical evaluation; one night ofpolysomnography; a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid; [11C]MRB PET-MR; as well as attentiontesting.\"},{\"abstract\":\"This proposed K23 career development award will provide Nancy Kerner, MD, Assistant professor of Psychiatryat Columbia University, with mentored career development to establish an independent research career in thestudy of the association of poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) anddementia. Poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms are common in older adults with mild cognitive impairment(MCI) and dementia, including Alzheimer?s disease and related dementias (ADRD), whereas more than half ofadults aged 65 years or older have sleep disorders, less than half are diagnosed. Also, there is strong evidencethat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in older adults, and some individuals with untreated OSAhave rapid cognitive transitions from normal cognition to MCI and from MCI to dementia. However, theassociations between poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms with clinical cognitive diagnoses have notbeen studied. The goal of this K23 award is to advance Dr. Kerner?s research career by (a) providing mentoredcareer development and training in patient-oriented research (POR) in sleep and circadian disturbances acrossall stages and (b) conducting a study to assess sleep and circadian rhythms with the PROMIS sleepquestionnaires and actigraphy among the elderly evaluated for ADRD in primary care practices. The proposedproject is an ancillary study to an ongoing project of dementia detection among persons 65 years or older withcognitive concerns in primary care, in which the primary mentor Luchsinger and co-mentor Devanand are theprincipal investigators. The primary aim is to examine cross-sectionally and longitudinally the association of poorsleep and disrupted circadian rhythms with cognitive diagnostic categories based on the NIA-AA criteria,including dementia, amnestic MCI single domain, amnestic MCI multiple domain, and cognitive impairment noMCI. The relation of OSA with diagnostic categories will also be explored. The secondary aim is to examine therelationship of cognitive transitions with new onset of abnormal sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms. Theexploratory aim is to explore the interactions of poor sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms with AD risk factors(e.g. APOE genotype) in relation to transitions from normal cognition to MCI and from MCI to dementia. Theseresearch aims will be complemented by training in (1) cognitive testing and diagnosis, (2) sleep and circadianrhythm scoring, (3) circadian metrics analyses, (4) statistical analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal data,(4) methods to assess temporality of associations, such as path analysis, and (5) mediation and moderationanalyses. Collectively, the career development plan, research project, and training activities will build a soundplatform for Dr. Kerner to become an independent investigator in sleep\\/circadian rhythms and ADRD research.--This application is responsive to the 2015 AD Summit recommendation to ?elucidate the short- and long-termconsequences of disrupted and optimized sleep on brain aging and AD.? Sleep and circadian rhythmdisturbances are common in elderly persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia; includingAlzheimer?s disease and related dementias (ADRD).

The scientific basis for focusing on this area of Patient-Oriented Research (POR) isthat increasingly, alterations in both systemic and brain vascular systems are being identified as risk factors andpotentially involved in the causal pathway for both age-related cognitive decline and dementia, including AD.Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer?s disease (AD) share many risk factors, such as hypertension anddiabetes. A common potentially unifying hypothesis is that both CVD and AD involve an endothelial dysfunctionalstate that affects multiple brain processes such as perfusion, hemodynamic regulation, blood-brain barrierpermeability, atherosclerotic progression and immune-inflammatory pathways leading to cognitive decline andAD pathology. From a therapeutic perspective, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have a pleiotropic effect onthe endothelium and my studies conducted over the last few years suggest it has a therapeutic potential. Mycareer aims under this application is to (a) establish a POR training program focused on clinical trials into mycurrent and future funded research activities; (b) Identify and train clinician and non-clinician investigators,particularly from underrepresented minorities, interested in being engaged in POR; and (c) enhance my researchskills- through learning new proteomic methods and cell biology for development of biomarkers in AD clinicaltrials, and mentorship skills in POR. To achieve these career goals, I will leverage an excellent research andtraining environment at Emory University and build on a robust ongoing and NIH-funded set of studies (1 cohortand 2 active clinical trials) to experientially learn and teach these new skills. Specifically, I propose ancillarystudies to my active research that aim to: (d) validate endothelial-based proteins discovered in untargetedproteomics in the CSF collected from individuals in my ongoing 3 studies and investigate if they are altered after1 year of angiotensin receptor blocker treatment; and (e) to investigate the effect of ARBs on progenitor cells,linked to AD, and perform a pilot study to assess if using scRNAseq on peripheral blood (with and withoutpharmacological bone marrow mobilization) reveals differential functions of these cells. The success inmentoring clinicians and scientists in POR to date and the robust and productive research activities ensures mysuccess. This K24 is a critical step in my midcareer to ultimately reach my leadership and independence goals.--The goal of this K24 application is to build a research and training program focusing on investigating the role ofthe vascular system in Alzheimer?s disease. It includes both career and mentoring plans for new and juniorinvestigators. It also supports 2 research projects that build on ongoing work and add new dimensions tomentoring and patient-oriented research.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive decline in Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) and many other age-related dementias have long beenassociated with the presence of insoluble amyloid plaques that disrupt normal synaptic functioning. However,more recent studies have revealed that synapse impairment from AD is much more potently associated withsoluble amyloid-beta oligomers (abo), rather than from insoluble fibrils. Soluble oligomers are structurallyirregular and promiscuously bind to membrane proteins, thereby dysregulating downstream amyloid assembliessuch as tau. These properties, unfortunately, have also made it difficult to experimentally characterize abo, sinceoligomeric states can be transient or otherwise observed as noise. Multiple genome-wide screening methods have identified cellular prion protein (PrPc) as a putative targetof abo, and subsequent studies have confirmed a pathophysiological pathway in AD involving abo-PrPc binding.Interestingly, ab monomers and insoluble fibrils do not bind to PrPc, thus the binding domain of PrPc can beexploited in peptide aptamers to target and stabilize abo. Here, we seek to utilize these interactions by designingbiomimetic PrPc peptides that complex soluble abo. Molecular simulations and amyloid-characterizingexperiments will be combined to optimize aptamer-abo interactions in order to abrogate binding of abo to PrPc.While aptamers are unlikely to serve as an AD therapeutic, amyloid-targeting PrPc peptides can guide theconstruction of next-generation agents that cross the blood-brain barrier and potently inhibit the toxicity of abo.Similarly, identification of abo by aptamers can potentially enable the tracking of soluble oligomers throughfluorescent tagging during the formation of insoluble fibrils. Given that there are few, if any methodologies totarget abo, this proposal would seek to isolate soluble oligomers and identify the limitations of their interactionswith membrane proteins. In order to synergistically combine molecular dynamics simulations with experiments, mentoring will becarried out on the use of NMR spectroscopy, chromatography, and ligand-binding assays to measure oligomerstructure, size, and the ability to bind PrP proteins, respectively. Mentoring will include regular meetings,coursework, workshops, and immersion in the laboratory of the primary mentor. Additionally, this study will seekto bridge basic biophysical research with clinically-relevant systems through the translation of model aptamersfrom simulations into experiments. Results will be connected to and interpreted in the context of Alzheimer?sDisease. The protocols and products developed as a result of this study will subsequently inform follow-upstudies of soluble amyloid toxicity in live cells, with extensions to multiple neurodegenerative diseases.--While Alzheimer?s Disease (AD) and other age-related dementias are correlated with a buildup of large proteinplaques in otherwise-healthy neurons; disease severity appears to be linked to the presence of small; irregularplaques that amplify signals of dysregulation. On their own; experiments have been unable to characterizeirregular plaque signaling; therefore the goal of this proposal is to combine molecular simulations withexperiments in order to stabilize and neutralize promiscuous plaques with pieces of the proteins they bind to.Successfully blocking promiscuous plaque signaling in model systems will provide the necessary requirementsfor potential AD therapeutics that seek to mitigate neurodegeneration; rather than abolishing it entirely.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/AbstractEpidemiologic evidence has established obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a risk factor for Alzheimer?s disease(AD). However, the mechanisms of this increase in AD risk remain unclear. Three potentially AD-relevant clinicalfeatures of OSA include severity of hypoxemia, global sleep fragmentation, and local deficits in memory-relevantsleep oscillations, i.e. slow waves and sleep spindles. These clinical features of OSA have been independentlylinked to amyloid and tau burden and accumulation, medial temporal lobe (MTL) degeneration, and MTL-dependent memory impairment?all hallmark biomarkers of AD. However, it remains unclear how each of thesefeatures relate to AD pathophysiology or MTL-dependent memory decline in patients with OSA. The overarchingresearch objective of this proposal is to address these unknowns. The proposed specific aims are to determinewhether distinct global and local OSA features are associated with 1) cortical amyloid burden, 2) MTL tau burden,and 3) degeneration of specific MTL brain circuits supporting multiple forms of memory known to depend onsleep and be vulnerable to AD pathophysiology. The proposed aims will be supported by leveraging existingresources, and collecting high density electroencephalography (hdEEG, 256 channels) sleep recordings incognitively normal older adults (60-85 years) undergoing positron emission tomography (PET) to assess amyloidand tau burden, as well as ultrahigh resolution magnetic resonance imaging (uhr-MRI) of MTL structure. Theproposed study will therefore capitalize on an opportunity to examine how OSA relates to AD pathologicalburden, MTL structure and function, and memory in an unprecedented level of detail and breadth. This iscongruent with both my short and long-term career goals. Specifically, I plan to generate research proposalsseeking funding to uncover the impact of distinct forms of sleep disturbance on circuit and molecular mechanismsof AD pathogenesis in humans. This will support my efforts to establish a clinical research program evaluating i)the contribution of sleep disturbance to the onset and progression of various forms of neurodegenerative diseaseacross clinical stages, ii) the utility of sleep-based biomarkers to predict dementia onset and aid differentialdiagnosis between dementias, and iii) the utility of targeted sleep-based interventions to arrest cognitive declineassociated with AD and related dementias. This research proposal and my long-term career goals are supportedby my training plan overseen by my mentoring team which includes experts in hdEEG, uhr-MRI, MTL-dependentmemory circuit function, PET methods in the context of aging and AD?including amyloid and tau PET, clinicalaspects of sleep disorders, geriatric psychiatry, and neurodegenerative disease, and clinical trial design andimplementation in the context of sleep disorders and AD. The proposed training plan includes structuredmentoring on each of these topics and participation in a clinical research certificate program, as well as a coursefocused on clinical trials in AD. By establishing this research program, I hope to develop sleep-based approachesto reduce risk, delay onset, and slow progression of dementia and age-related cognitive decline.--Project NarrativeThe proposed project seeks to determine how obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases Alzheimer's disease(AD) risk by examining how intermittent pauses in breathing; sleep fragmentation; and local deficits in memory-relevant brain waves during sleep relate to AD pathology; structural integrity of medial temporal lobe memorycircuits; and the acquisition and retention of episodic and procedural memories. The findings that emerge fromthis research will characterize which clinical features of OSA are mechanisms underlying the observed increasein AD risk; as well as elucidate whether this increased risk is due to facilitation of AD pathological accumulation;increased vulnerability to AD pathologies due to erosion of medial temporal lobe memory circuits; or both. Thiswork will ultimately offer early; circuit-specific; mechanistic targets supporting the development of novelinterventions to delay AD onset; slow AD progression; and minimize cognitive decline in older adults with OSA.\"},{\"abstract\":\"ABSTRACTThis is an Independent Scientist Award (K02) application to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) from Dr.Alexandru Movila, Ph.D. who is an earlier stage investigator. Dr. Movila is an Assistant Professor in his third yearappointment in the Department of Periodontology at Nova Southeastern University (NSU). Throughout his facultycareer, Dr. Movila has established a strong publication record as an independent investigator in the field of oralinflammation induced by oral pathogens. His research is currently supported by R01AG064003, R03DE027153,and R15DE28699 grants addressing molecular mechanisms of ceramide lipids-induced periodontitis in relationto aging. Because the emerging evidence indicates that virulence factors secreted by periodontal pathogensmay be engaged in initiation and\\/or progression of Alzheimer?s disease, the scientific goal of Dr. Movila is toestablish a foundation of research for elucidation of pathogenic engagement of periodontal disease in the onsetand progression of Alzheimer?s disease. Further, Dr. Movila?s long-term career goal is to become a leading basicresearch scientist in the field of aging and Alzheimer?s disease research. Currently, the PI has very limitedexperience in the pathophysiology of age-dependent neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer?s disease.However, due to the current workload at NSU that involve teaching and research mentoring of undergraduateand graduate dental students, he can only allocate a limited time for the research on Alzheimer?s diseaseassociated with periodontitis. Thus, this career development KO2 award would provide the protected time togain expertise in a new field of research. Based on his existing expertise in the oral pathogenesis and preliminaryresults, Dr. Movila hypothesized that ceramide lipid produced by the key periodontal pathogen Porphyromonasgingvalis, is engaged in Alzheimer?s disease pathogenesis via elevation of the hyper-phosphorylation of tau andamyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein. The primary career development goals of this K02application are: 1) to identify the possible pathogenic factors produced by periodontal pathogens that promotesprogression of the Alzheimer?s disease pathology, 2) to receive hands-on training to learn the pre-clinicalexperimental mouse models of Alzheimer?s disease, 3) to establish academic collaborations with distinguishedresearchers in the fields; and 4) to build up academic credential in the Alzheimer disease research. The proposedcareer development training and research studies will help to Dr. Movila not only improving his knowledge andskill to study Alzheimer?s disease, but also increasing the network for collaborations and reputation in the field.--NARRATIVEThe proposed studies will investigate the association of chronic periodontitis with the hallmark pathologicfeatures of Alzheimer?s Disease. More specifically; we will address the role of a new class of dihydroceramidelipids; named phosphoglycerol dihydroceramide (PGDHC); produced by the key periodontal pathogenPorphyromonas gignivalis in phosphorilation of tau and amyloid pathology using mouse models ofperiodontatititis and Alzheimer?s disease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Aging leads to the decline of brain structure and function which increases the susceptibility to neurodegenerativedisorders. Work from the Wyss-Coray lab support a cell non-autonomous and reversible mechanism of brainaging regulated by the systemic milieu. Aged plasma drives brain aging in young mice as shown by the reductionin hippocampal neurogenesis, increase in microglia reactivity, and decline in cognitive functions. While youngplasma reverses these hallmarks in aged mice. As the identity of the pro-youthful and pro-aging factors is beingrevealed, it remains unclear how they signal into the brain across the highly impermeable blood brain barrier.Recent work from our lab revealed that aged plasma upregulates on brain endothelial cells (BEC) the expressionof an adhesion protein VCAM1 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1), which also increases during normal aging.The genetic ablation of VCAM1 from BECs or its neutralization with a systemic antibody abolishes the effects ofaged plasma and reverses hallmarks of brain aging. This supports a crucial role for VCAM1 as a mediator ofage-related circulatory cues. Yet it remains unclear how VCAM1 alters BECs to drive brain aging. At a single celllevel, VCAM1 expressing BECs exhibit a high inflammatory profile compared to VCAM1 negative BECs andblocking VCAM1 reduces brain inflammation suggesting that it may induce the inflammatory signaling in BECs.In addition to aging, VCAM1 increases in the cerebral vessels of Alzheimer?s disease (AD) mice and colocalizeswith amyloid plaques and reactive microglia. Soluble VCAM1 also increases in AD patient plasma and highlycorrelates with dementia severity and pathological hallmarks of AD. Based on these combined observations, thisproposal will test the hypothesis that increased VCAM1 disrupts brain endothelial cell signaling during aging andpromotes AD-like disease in mice. Aim 1 will determine whether VCAM1 induces the expression of inflammatorygenes in aged BEC using single cell transcriptomic analysis of hippocampal BECs and proteomic analysis ofmicrovessels. Experiments will be performed using aged mice where VCAM1 is genetically ablated from BECsor neutralized with an antibody and using young mice where VCAM1 is overexpressed in BEC using the AAV2-BR1 virus. Aim 2 will identify the mechanism behind which VCAM1 signals to induce BEC activation. PrimaryBECs overexpressing wild-type or mutant VCAM1 will be cultured in the presence or absence of the VCAM1ligand VLA-4 (very late antigen-4) to determine its effect on the expression of inflammatory genes in BEC. MutantVCAM1 that shows the highest reduction in BEC activation will be introduced in vivo using the AAV2-BR1 virusto assess microglia reactivity and neural stem cell activity. Aim 3 will determine the role of VCAM1 in a mousemodel of AD. VCAM1 neutralizing antibody will be systemically introduced to determine its effect on amyloidplaques, reactive microglia, cognitive deficits, and the activation of BECs as measured by transcriptomic analysisof inflammatory genes. This project will identify aging-induced inflammatory pathways altered by VCAM1 in BECsalong with its mechanism of signaling, and determine the potential of VCAM1 as a therapeutic target for AD.--Project NarrativeBrain aging leads to cognitive and physical impairments and significantly increases the risk of neurodegenerativedisorders including Alzheimer?s disease. With very few effective treatments and taking into account our agingpopulation; there is an increased need for novel therapeutic targets to neurological disorders. This work willidentify signaling pathways altered in the cerebrovascular by an adhesion protein that contributes to brain agingand will determine its potential as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer?s disease; the results of which will advanceour knowledge of brain aging and Alzheimer?s disease and may uncover novel therapeutic targets.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Aging and hypertension are primary risk factors for the development of cerebral vascular disease (CVD), stroke,vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), and Alzheimer?s disease (AD). However, the genes and pathwaysdetermining genetic susceptibility are unknown. In preliminary studies, Dr. Roman?s lab identified sequencevariants in t h e CYP4A11 and 4F2 genes, which inhibit the formation of 20-HETE, are associated with loss ofhippocampal and AD signature region volumes, and cognitive dysfunction in 4,286 elderly patients in theAtherosclerosis Risk in Communities-Neurocognitive Study (ARIC-NCS). These same variants have beenpreviously linked to hypertension and stroke, but their contribution to the loss of cognition with aging is novel.Little is known about the cells that produce 20-HETE or express its newly discovered GPR75 receptor in thebrain or the influence of aging and hypertension on the expression of this pathway. 20-HETE inhibitors havebeen reported to attenuate the myogenic response of cerebral arteries and autoregulation of cerebral blood flow(CBF). Autoregulation of CBF protects the brain from increases in capillary pressure, blood-brain barrier (BBB)leakage, and neurological damage following elevations in blood pressure. Autoregulation of CBF to elevationsin pressure is often impaired in elderly, hypertensive, diabetic and AD patients, but its role in the development ofcognitive impairment remains to be determined. To validate the association between CYP4A\\/F mutations anddementia, and to determine the mechanisms involved, Dr Roman?s group identified a homologous geneticdeficiency in the formation of 20-HETE in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats, and confirmed they exhibit impairedautoregulation of CBF. They also created transgenic rescue models on the SS genetic background. This projectwill now test the hypothesis that a genetic deficiency in the formation of 20-HETE, which impairs CBFautoregulation, increases pressure to cerebral capillaries to promote BBB leakage, neurodegeneration, andcognitive dysfunction with aging and\\/or hypertension. We will identify the cellular localization of the enzymes thatproduce 20-HETE and its receptors in the brain, and determine if knock-in of the wild-type Cyp4A1 gene in youngand elderly SS rats restores the production of 20-HETE and protects against the development of cognitiveimpairment with aging and\\/or hypertension. This work has exceedingly high translational value and should leadto the development of genetic tests to identify patients with CYP4A11 and 4F2 mutations that may be at risk forthe development of cognitive impairment.--In preliminary studies; we found that sequence variants in the CYP4A11 and 4F2 genes; that reduce theproduction of 20-HETE; are associated with loss of cognitive function with aging in &gt;4000 elderly patients butthe mechanisms involved are unknown. We also identified a homologous genetic deficiency in 20-HETEproduction in Dahl salt-sensitive rats and confirmed that they also exhibit impaired autoregulation of cerebralblood flow and cognitive dysfunction with aging and hypertension. This proposal will determine the mechanismsby which decreased 20-HETE and impaired cerebral hemodynamics promotes loss of cognitive function withaging and hypertension.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project Summary\\/AbstractAlzheimer?s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes significant individual suffering anda major public health burden. The poorly elucidated pathophysiology of Alzheimer?s disease limits thedevelopment of effective disease modifying therapy and, as a result, there are currently no therapeuticinterventions that halt or reverse the disease process. It is becoming clear that cerebrovascular dysfunction andcardiovascular disease are major contributors to neurodegeneration and dementia. Cerebrovascular dysfunctionis the first and most significant abnormality that occurs in Alzheimer?s disease and may interact with otherpathological factors to drive the pathological progression of Alzheimer?s disease. The two hallmark pathologiesof Alzheimer?s disease are the extracellular ?-amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composedof tau protein. Preliminary studies show that transmissible soluble tau aggregates, a species of tau that isimplicated in the spread of tau pathology and neurodegeneration, accumulate in cerebrovascular endothelialcells in vitro, in several mouse models of tauopathy, and in human patients diagnosed with Alzheimer?s diseaseor other tauopathies. Exposure to soluble tau aggregates causes endothelial cell dysfunction in vitro.Furthermore, mouse models of tauopathy show impaired endothelial function by middle age. The mechanism bywhich soluble tau aggregates are transmitted to endothelial cells and their role in the development ofcerebrovascular dysfunction, however, are unclear. Published literature show that soluble tau aggregates spreadfrom neuron to neuron by binding cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). Based on these findings,the proposed studies will test the hypothesis that soluble tau aggregate transmission to microvascular endothelialcells is mediated by tau binding to cell surface HSPG and drives endothelial dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. Aim1 will determine the role of tau binding to cell surface HSPG in soluble tau aggregate entry into endothelial cellsand the development of endothelial cell dysfunction in vitro. Aim 2 will determine the role of soluble tauaggregates in the development of endothelial dysfunction in a mouse model of tauopathy by removing solubletau aggregates from the brain using antibody treatment. These studies will make use of the detailed specificityof in vitro techniques and the translatability of in vivo approaches to characterize a novel element ofcerebrovascular pathology and Alzheimer?s disease pathophysiology. Completion of the studies proposed willprovide crucial knowledge about the etiological determinants of Alzheimer?s disease. This knowledge can beused in the development of therapeutic interventions that target cerebrovascular dysfunction, the first abnormalitythat occurs in Alzheimer?s disease. The completion of the studies proposed and the training activities detailed inthis application will also prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent clinician scientist.--Project NarrativeThe brain is one of the highest consumers of energy in the body; yet; it is not able to store energy which makesit solely reliant on blood flow to receive energy. Deterioration of the brain?s vascular blood supply is a commoncomponent of aging and occurs early in Alzheimer?s disease. Our studies will determine how the spread of tauprotein; which plays an important role in Alzheimer?s disease development; to the brain vasculature can causedeterioration of the vascular health of the brain and contribute to Alzheimer?s disease progression.\"},{\"abstract\":\"PROJECT SUMMARY\\/ABSTRACTThere is currently no cure for Alzheimer?s disease, the most prevalent cause of dementia worldwide, and thelimited treatments only slow disease progression. Alzheimer?s disease is characterized by pathogenic amyloidbeta (A?) plaque accumulation, tau tangles, and cognitive impairment. Subclinical epileptiform activity orseizures, which are indicative of network hyperexcitability, are also present in early Alzheimer?s disease (definedby normal cognition and preclinical plaque pathology). Interestingly, epileptiform activity is greater and seizurethresholds are lower during the inactive phase (night in humans) in general and in Alzheimer?s disease. Thismay be exacerbated in Alzheimer?s disease patients because of documented disruptions in their sleep wakecycle, which is driven by the circadian clock. Circadian rhythms are endogenous oscillations in physiology andbehavior occurring over a 24-hour period. They are driven by a cellular transcription-translation feedback loop,involving the proteins BMAL1, PER1\\/2, and CRY1\\/2, collectively known as the molecular clock. Circadian rhythmdriven day-night differences are seen in healthy cognitive function, network activity (epileptiform activity andseizures), and protein expression, including proteins involved in synaptic function and pathogenic proteins suchas A?. While these rhythms are perturbed in Alzheimer?s disease, little work has been done to investigate theconsequences of day-night disruptions of neurophysiology in Alzheimer?s disease and how these disruptionsmight exacerbate disease pathology. Published literature and preliminary data suggest that decreased inhibitionduring the day plays a role in the observed hyperexcitability and cognitive impairment, but little has been doneto elucidate the role of loss of day-night differences in hippocampal inhibition in cognitive impairment and A?pathology. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that the loss of hippocampal day-time inhibition inAlzheimer?s disease contributes to cognitive impairment and A? pathogenesis by determining if this day-nightdifference in physiology is altered in the J20 mouse model of Alzheimer?s disease, and if restoring this day-nightdifference is necessary and sufficient to rescue cognitive impairment and A? pathology. This will beaccomplished through electrophysiology, chemogenetics, biochemical, and behavioral assays. Additionally, theproposed experiments will be completed under the guidance of my sponsor and co-sponsor, both experts incircadian clocks and Alzheimer?s disease respectively, as well as in an environment ideally suited forunderstanding the molecular and functional deficits contributing to Alzheimer?s disease. Uncovering day-nightdifferences in physiology and disruptions of that physiology will not only provide insight to possible therapeutictargets, but also when interventions should be administered to most effectively ameliorate Alzheimer?s diseasesymptoms or delay pathological onset.--PROJECT NARRATIVEAlzheimer?s disease is the most prevalent cause of dementia worldwide affecting over 5 million people in theUnited States alone with treatments that only manage symptoms and no cure. We propose to examine how day-night differences in neurophysiology affect cognition and amyloid beta pathology in Alzheimer?s disease throughelectrophysiological; biochemical; chemogenetic; and behavioral assays. Given that Alzheimer?s diseasepatients exhibit circadian dysregulation in cognitive function and amyloid beta expression; understandingcircadian timing of neurophysiology is critical to understanding and treating Alzheimer?s disease.\"},{\"abstract\":\"With this Phase II submission, IsoPlexis will develop an automated system to evaluate the combined peripheralimmune response of T cells and monocyte cells to differentiate and monitor neurodegenerative diseases (ND)including Alzheimer?s (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Monitoring diseaseprogression and treatment impact on the immune response currently requires risky Cerebral Spinal Fluidsampling. However, the communication between the central and peripheral immune systems exists and weshow it requires a sophisticated single-cell detection system to decipher these interactions from a blood sample.The limited success of current ADRD treatments has led to two key observations: (1) targeting molecularcontributors to disease without impacting the inflammatory response or disease progression, or (2)immunotherapy targeting not providing measurably productive outcomes and inducing unfavorable inflammatoryside effects. Multiplexed protein biomarkers have proven critical in other human immune therapies (e.g., cancer),drastically improving clinical success and inspiring the extension of this technology towards ADRD. Developingsuch biomarkers for ADRD requires a technology that (1) measures secreted protein polyfunctionality in a single-cell platform classified by subsets of ADRD peripheral blood cells, (2) isolates sensitive peripheral immune cellsnecessary to establish correlative biomarker disease profiles, and (3) is able to monitor these emergingbiomarkers upon treatment. The IsoPlexis IsoCode?s polyfunctional strength index (PSI), using 30+ secretedproteins per T-cell, has proven to be a correlate of objective response in multiple types of immunotherapies. Ina published study on MS patient samples, the IsoPlexis platform has demonstrated a strong stimulatory andinflammatory cytokine secretion profile from monocytes, compared to that of healthy donors, and this secretionprofile is greatly reduced upon successful treatment. Initial studies of AD peripheral T cells have shown anincreased inflammatory profile relative to age-matched donors driven by unique polyfunctional subsets. With aunique focus on the ND market need, we wish to transition this technology into a fully viable commercial,automated assay system to greatly expedite the industry?s development of ADRD therapies. This Phase II planenables beta-testing in clinical settings with strong scientific performance history. Aim 1: Develop an automated?flow cell? consumable compartment, which captures ADRD monocytes and T cells in parallel and measures 32-plex single-cell cytokine secretions. Aim 2: Produce a miniaturized, benchtop automated flow cell analysis andworkflow system, with cell enrichment module, to provide clinical labs user-friendly sample to answer format.Aim 3: Demonstrate proof-of-concept ability to use IsoPlexis automation at UCI, UCSF and UCONN trials and toprofile polyfunctional response of peripheral immune cells in a comparative study of neurodegenerative diseases.--Alzheimer?s Disease and related diseases involve neuroinflammation effects that occur while neuronal cells areaberrantly degraded. Taking advantage of the communication between the central immune system in the centralnervous system and peripheral blood immune system; IsoPlexis is developing a comprehensive blood-based;biomarker detection system for Alzheimer?s Disease and related diseases. By developing the IsoPlexisautomated high-throughput platform to make highly-multiplexed; single-cell measurements that detect andclassify proteomic information by different immune cell types will enable researchers and clinicians make precisetherapy decisions for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer?s Disease; Multiple Sclerosis;and Frontotemporal Dementia.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Project SummaryOur prior studies suggest that stiffening within the aortic arch (as quantified by aortic arch PWV measured byMRI) disrupts coupling in the aortic-brain system and consequently increases hemodynamic pulsatilitytransmitted to the brain. This project will test the hypothesis that aortic arch stiffness contributes to age-related brain insults beyond its influence on central pulse pressure by disrupting healthy aorta-brainsystem dynamics. We are proposing a systems approach, synergistically combining advanced MRI, fluiddynamics, and mathematical modeling to understand the basic physics and physiology underlying aorta-brainhemodynamics. We will test our hypothesis with three specific aims: 1.) Study the mechanisms whereby aorticarch stiffness impacts the hemodynamics of pulsatile energy transmission to the brain. 2.) Define a systemsmodel based on the intrinsic frequency (IF) method to describe the healthy aorta-brain system vs. the systemperturbed by aortic arch stiffness. 3). Use mechanistic approaches to understand the impact of disrupted aorta-brain coupling on brain health and cognitive function. We will use cardiovascular MRI techniques to directlyassess key vascular properties of the system guiding pulsatile wave transmission in the aortic-brain systemincluding assessment of aortic arch stiffness as well as downstream cerebrovascular resistance and compliance.We will prospectively study 150 non-demented elders from a deeply phenotyped cohort from a concurrent BrainAging Study at Huntington Medical Research Institutes (HMRI). Brain vascular function will be richlycharacterized using a combination of imaging techniques and biomarker analysis from bloodwork andcerebrospinal fluid. Our MRI vascular assessments include automated quantification of white matterhyperintensity (WMH) volume as well as cerebrovascular reactivity. Brain integrity and risk for neurodegenerativedisease will be assessed with CSF beta-amyloid (A?) measurements and a comprehensive neuropsychologicalbattery which includes indices of global function, memory, and executive function. Arterial function will becharacterized using MRI measures of blood flow in the aorta and carotid artery combined with arterial tonometryfor quantification of the pulsatile hemodynamic energy transmission to the brain, wave reflection analysis, andevaluation of vascular compliance and resistance. Vascular function data will determine physiologic parametersfor an in-vitro LV-aortic simulator (that includes cerebral vasculature) and computational fluid dynamics modelswhich will also direct mathematical systems analysis of the aorta-brain system using intrinsic frequency (IF)method. These studies are designed to enhance understanding of how aortic stiffening leads todementia. Our long-term goal is to develop non-invasive, inexpensive, and easy-to-use measures of brainvascular health that can be used to identify, predict, and quantify risk of vascular brain damage.--Project NarrativeThis project will expand our understanding of hemodynamic interactions between aortic stiffness and brainblood vessels that mediate hypertensive brain insults and contributes to dementia risk.

The causes of ADRD remain poorly understood, and there is acritical need to identify novel modifiable risk factors as well as biological mechanisms of ADRD. Recentepidemiological studies, including those published by investigators of the proposed study, suggest that age-related impairment of the internal circadian clock may play a role in the development of ADRD in older menand women. However it remains unclear what biological mechanisms may drive the associations betweenweakened circadian rhythms and ADRD. Recent applications of metabolomics in epidemiological and clinicalstudies suggest that there may be common metabolic pathways associated with both circadian disruption andADRD. This raises the possibility that age-related impairment in circadian rhythms may drive metabolicchanges, which in turn lead to the development of ADRD. This hypothesis is further supported by our excitingmetabolomics data from 50 men in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study: We found that bothweakened rest-activity rhythms and impaired cognitive function are associated with increases in ?-glutamyldipeptides, bile acids, fatty acids and acylcarnitines, but decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Based onthe compelling data from epidemiological studies, as well as the intriguing findings from our metabolomics pilot,we propose to comprehensively examine characteristics of the rest-activity rhythms and metabolomic profilesin relation to long-term cognitive outcomes. Our metabolomics study will include 1500 older men and womenwith 500 incident dementia cases from two unique and complimentary cohorts, the Women?s Health Initiativeand the MrOS. The current study includes three specific aims and one exploratory aim: Aim 1: Determine thegender-specific relationships between rest-activity rhythms and long-term cognitive outcomes including ADRDin older men and women. Aim 2: Identify metabolomics signatures that are associated with characteristics ofrest-activity rhythms and incident ADRD, respectively. Aim 3: Test whether common metabolites and pathwaysmediate relationships between rest-activity rhythms and incident ADRD. For the Exploratory Aim, we willexamine the relationship between baseline rest-activity rhythms, changes in metabolomics markers, and long-term cognitive outcomes in the subset of 300 MrOS participants with repeated serum samples. Our study isinnovative because it focuses on weakened circadian rhythms as a novel risk factor for ADRD. Moreover, itgoes beyond characterizing associations and focuses on identifying metabolic pathways linking rest-activityrhythms with ADRD in a large population of free-living older adults. The proposed study is significant becauseit has the potential to identify predictive and mechanistic biomarkers that may lead to better prevention,diagnosis and treatment of ADRD.--PROJECT NARRATIVEOur study has potentially important public health and clinical impacts because findings from our study maymotivate the development of prevention strategies aimed at improving rest-activity rhythms to reduce theburden of ADRD. In addition; metabolic pathways and markers identified in our study may help developbiomarker panels for better risk prediction and management in high-risk populations; such as those withevident sleep and circadian impairment. Finally; our study may also help develop intermediate marker panelsfor better evaluation of preventive and therapeutic strategies that focus on improving circadian function toreduce ADRD burden in the older population.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Neurons lack energy stores and thus their ongoing function is dependent on the delivery of energysubstrates in the blood. Precise control of brain blood flow is therefore essential for neuronalhealth. However, the mechanisms through which blood flow through the brain is regulated remainunclear. Furthering our understanding of this process is critical, as it is increasingly appreciatedthat disruption of brain blood flow is one of the earliest pathological events in Alzheimer?s disease,and may be a key contributory factor to disease progression. Thus, advancing our understandingof the mechanisms of blood flow control in normal physiology, and their disruption in the contextof Alzheimer?s disease, may reveal novel and much needed targets for therapeutic intervention.Pericytes are mural cells that reside on brain capillaries, interposed between endothelial cells andastrocytic endfeet. It is thought that these cells contribute to the control of brain blood flow butmechanistic details are lacking. Based on the preliminary data in this proposal, we posit thatpericytes are ideally positioned and equipped to act as metabolic sentinels in the control of brainblood flow. Specifically, we show for the first time that acutely isolated brain pericytes possessfunctional KATP channels, and we demonstrate that these open in response to depletion of glucoseto cause contractile capillary pericyte, and upstream arteriole smooth muscle, relaxation. Thisdrives capillary and arteriole dilation and an increase in brain blood flow. This has profoundimplications for understanding how blood flow is controlled in the brain, as local glucoseconcentrations are known to transiently decrease during neuronal activity. Our data offer anexplanation for this phenomenon?during increases in neuronal glucose utilization, pericytessense falling local concentrations which triggers KATP-mediated hyperpolarizing electrical signalsthat relax both pericytes themselves and upstream arteriolar smooth muscle. This increases bloodflow to compensate for the local decrease in glucose, thereby protecting brain metabolism.Strikingly, this pericyte metabolism-electrical coupling mechanism is profoundly disrupted in amouse model of Alzheimer?s disease, suggesting that loss of this blood flow control mechanismmay contribute to a mismatch between neuronal energy demand and supply, precipitating neuronaldysfunction and cognitive decline. Using these findings as a springboard, we propose to determinethe molecular composition and metabolic regulation of KATP channels in pericytes throughout thebrain. We will define the precise mechanisms that engage pericyte KATP channels to control bloodflow, and we will determine the mechanisms through which pericyte control of brain blood flowis disrupted in Alzheimer?s disease.--Precise control of blood flow is essential for ensuring brain cells have enough energy (extracted from the sugar; glucose; and oxygen) to fulfill their functions. Early in the development of Alzheimer?s disease?a devastating condition affecting almost 6 million Americans?brain blood flow control is disrupted; but it is unclear how this happens. Here; we reveal a novelelectrical signaling mechanism that brain pericytes (cells that sit on the smallest blood vessels -capillaries) use to adjust blood flow to compensate for decreases in local glucose and protect brain metabolism. We demonstrate that this mechanism is disrupted in a mouse model ofAlzheimer?s disease; leading to loss of blood flow control. Therefore; this work may identify novel targets on pericytes for therapies aimed at protecting or restoring blood flow in Alzheimer?s patients.\"},{\"abstract\":\"Geroscience hypothesis posits that aging itself is the underlying major risk factor for  age-related chronic diseases, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD); therefore, delaying aging delays disease, including AD. This proposal will examine the reciprocal relationship between circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) and AD pathology. Circadian rhythms, which are intimately interlinked with cellular metabolism, orchestrate the coordinated expression and function of multiple pathways that support normal cellular function and repair in both neural and peripheral tissues. Circadian rhythms deteriorate with aging, and Alzheimer's patients show disrupted circadian rhythm. However, the causal role of CRD for AD is not clear. The proposal will assess the relationship between circadian rhythm disruption and AD pathology, will test whether improvement in circadian rhythms delay the onset and progression of AD. and will attempt to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.Well-characterized Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) models of AD with Drosophila genetic tools will be used to test the impact of genetic or environmental CRD on the onset and severity of the multiorgan functional decline in AD. One feature of CRD is the lack of feeding consolidation to daylight hours in diurnal animals. To restore aspects of circadian rhythm in older flies, animals will be subject to time-restricted feeding (TRF) in which food is provided to flies only during the 12 h day time. TRF does not reduce daily caloric intake and imparts a molecular signature that is distinct from that under caloric restriction. Disease onset and severity will be assessed in TRF, and ad lib fed (ALF) flies to determine if TRF is an effective behavioral intervention for AD. To test the molecular pathways mediating the opposite effects of CRD and TRF on AD pathologies, time-series transcriptomes from these flies will be analyzed to find candidate pathways. The functional significance of these pathways will be tested by expressing genetic gain of function and loss of function alleles in AD flies. Our novel in vivo genetic-transgenic Drosophila disease model coupled with ultrastructural, functional, metabolic, and transcriptome techniques will generate unbiased insights into the mechanistic basis of accelerated aging in production of AD. Successful completion of this project will provide a deeper molecular understanding of the interaction between circadian rhythm and genetic risk of AD. Additionally, this research will assess the efficacy of a behavioral intervention that would have a high potential for adoption in humans.--Sleep and circadian rhythm deteriorate with aging and compromise the function of the brain and body. This proposal suggests a method for investigating how chronic circadian rhythm disruption; which is intimately interlinked with cellular metabolism; affects Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Conversely; optimum eating time will be used a novel intervention to optimize circadian rhythm and reduce the severity of AD pathology.\"}]",
